# flake8 settings for Spack.
#
# Below we describe which flake8 checks Spack ignores and what the
# rationale is.
#
# Let people line things up nicely:
# - E129: visually indented line with same indent as next logical line
# - E221: multiple spaces before operator
# - E241: multiple spaces after ','
# - E272: multiple spaces before keyword
#
# Let people use terse Python features:
# - E731: lambda expressions
#
# Spack allows wildcard imports:
# - F403: disable wildcard import
#
# These are required to get the package.py files to test clean:
# - F405: `name` may be undefined, or undefined from star imports: `module`
# - F821: undefined name `name` (needed for cmake, configure, etc.)
# - F999: syntax error in doctest
#
