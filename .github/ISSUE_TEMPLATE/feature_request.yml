        If you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on [our Slack](https://slack.spack.io/) first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.

        Other than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack!
