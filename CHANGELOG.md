# v1.0.0 (2025-07-20)

`v1.0.0` is a major feature release and a significant milestone. It introduces compiler
dependencies, a foundational change that has been in development for almost seven years,
and the project's first stable package API.

If you are interested in more information, you can find more details on the road to
v1.0, as well as its features, in talks from the 2025 Spack User Meeting. For example:
* [State of the Spack Community](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rInmUfuiZQ&list=PLRKq_yxxHw29-JcpG2CZ-xKK2U8Hw8O1t&index=2)
* [Spack v1.0 overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFksqSDNwQA&list=PLRKq_yxxHw29-JcpG2CZ-xKK2U8Hw8O1t&index=4)

Introducing some of these features required us to make breaking changes. In most cases,
we've also provided tools (in the form of Spack commands) that you can use to
automatically migrate your packages and configuration.

## Stable Package API

In Spack `v1.0`, the package repository is separate from the Spack tool, giving you more
control over the versioning of package recipes. There is also a stable
[Package API](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/package_api.html) that is versioned
separately from Spack.

This release of Spack supports package API from `v1.0` up to `v2.2`. The older `v1.0`
package API is deprecated and may be removed in a future release, but we are
guaranteeing that any Spack `v1.x` release will be backward compatible with Package API
`v.2.x` -- i.e., it can execute code from the packages in *this* Spack release.

See the
[Package API Documentation](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/package_api.html) for
full details on package versioning and compatibility. The high level details are:

  1. The `spack.package` Python module defines the Package API;
  2. The Package API *minor version* is incremented when new functions or classes are exported from `spack.package`; and
  3. The major version is incremented when functions or classes are removed or have breaking changes to their signatures (a rare occurrence).

This independent versioning allows package authors to utilize new Spack features without
waiting for a new Spack release. Older Spack packages (API `v1.0`) may import code from
outside of `spack.package`, e.g., from `spack.*` or `llnl.util.*`. This is deprecated
and *not* included in the API guarantee. We will remove support for these packages in a
future Spack release.

### Separate Package Repository

The Spack `builtin` package repository no longer lives in the Spack git repository. You
can find it here:

* https://github.com/spack/spack-packages

Spack clones the package repository automatically when you first run, so you do not have
to manage this manually. By default, Spack version `v1.0` uses the `v2025.07` release of
`spack-packages`. You can find out more about it by looking at the
[package releases](https://github.com/spack/spack-packages/releases).

Downloaded package repos are stored by default within `~/.spack`, but the fetch
destination can be configured. (#50650). If you want your package repository to live
somewhere else, run, e.g.:

```
spack repo set --destination ~/spack-packages builtin
```

You can also configure your *own* package repositories to be fetched automatically from
git urls, just as you can with `builtin`. See the
[repository configuration docs](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/repositories.html)
for details.

### Updating and Pinning Packages

You can tell Spack to update the core package repository from a branch. For example, on
`develop` or on a release, you can run commands like:

  ```shell
  # pull the latest packages
  spack repo update
  ```
or

  ```shell
  # check out a specific commit of the spack-packages repo
  spack repo update --commit 2bf4ab9585c8d483cc8581d65912703d3f020393 builtin
  ```

which will set up your configuration like this:

  ```yaml
  repos:
    builtin:
      git: "https://github.com/spack/spack-packages.git"
      commit: 2bf4ab9585c8d483cc8581d65912703d3f020393
  ```

You can use this within an environment to pin a specific version of its package files.
See the
[repository configuration docs](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/repositories.html)
for more details (#50868, #50997, #51021).

### Breaking changes related to package repositories

1. The builtin repo now lives in `var/spack/repos/spack_repo/builtin` instead of
   `var/spack/repos/builtin`, and it has a new layout, which you can learn about in the
   [repo docs](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/repositories.html).

2. The module `spack.package` no longer exports the following symbols, mostly related to
   build systems: `AspellDictPackage`, `AutotoolsPackage`, `BundlePackage`,
   `CachedCMakePackage`, `cmake_cache_filepath`, `cmake_cache_option`,
   `cmake_cache_path`, `cmake_cache_string`, `CargoPackage`, `CMakePackage`,
   `generator`, `CompilerPackage`, `CudaPackage`, `Package`, `GNUMirrorPackage`,
   `GoPackage`, `IntelPackage`, `IntelOneApiLibraryPackageWithSdk`,
   `IntelOneApiLibraryPackage`, `IntelOneApiStaticLibraryList`, `IntelOneApiPackage`,
   `INTEL_MATH_LIBRARIES`, `LuaPackage`, `MakefilePackage`, `MavenPackage`,
   `MesonPackage`, `MSBuildPackage`, `NMakePackage`, `OctavePackage`, `PerlPackage`,
   `PythonExtension`, `PythonPackage`, `QMakePackage`, `RacketPackage`, `RPackage`,
   `ROCmPackage`, `RubyPackage`, `SConsPackage`, `SIPPackage`, `SourceforgePackage`,
   `SourcewarePackage`, `WafPackage`, `XorgPackage`

   These are now part of the `builtin` package repository, not part of core spack or its
   package API. When using repositories with package API `v2.0` and higher, *you must
   explicitly import these package classes* from the appropriate module in
   `spack_repo.builtin.build_systems` (see #50452 for more).

   e.g., for `CMakePackage`, you would write:

     ```python
     from spack_repo.builtin.build_systems.cmake import CMakePackage
     ```

   Note that `GenericBuilder` and `Package` *are* part of the core package API. They are
   currently re-exported from `spack_repo.builtin.build_systems.generic` for backward
   compatibility but may be removed from the package repo. You should prefer to import
   them from `spack.package`.

   The original names will still work for old-style (`v1.0`) package repositories but
   *not* in `v2.0` package repositories. Note that this means that the API stability
   promise does *not* include old-style package repositories. They are deprecated and
   will be removed in a future version. So, you should update as soon as you can.

3. Package directory names within `v2.0` repositories are now valid Python modules

    | Old                   | New                   | Description                         |
    |-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|
    | `py-numpy/package.py` | `py_numpy/package.py` | hyphen is replaced by underscore.   |
    | `7zip/package.py`     | `_7zip/package.py`    | leading digits now preceded by _    |
    | `pass/package.py`     | `_pass/package.py`    | Python reserved words preceded by _ |


4. Spack has historically injected `import` statements into package recipes, so there
   was no need to use `from spack.package import *` (though we have included it in
   `builtin` packages for years. `from spack.package import *` (or more specific
   imports) will be necessary in packages. The magic we added in the early days of Spack
   was causing IDEs, code editors, and other tools not to be able to understand Spack
   packages. Now they use standard Python import semantics and should be compatible with
   modern Python tooling. This change was also necessary to support Python 3.13. (see
   #47947 for more details).

### Migrating to the new package API

Support will remain in place for the old repository layout for *at least a year*, so
that you can continue to use old-style repos in conjunction with earlier versions. If
you have custom repositories that need to migrate to the new layout, you can upgrade
them to package API `v2.x` by running:

```
spack repo migrate
```

This will make the following changes to your repository:

   1. If you used to import from `spack.pkg.builtin` in Python, you now need to import
      from `spack_repo.builtin` instead:

       ```python
       # OLD: no longer supported
       from spack.pkg.builtin.my_pkg import MyPackage

       # NEW: spack_repo is a Python namespace package
       from spack_repo.builtin.packages.my_pkg.package import MyPackage
       ```
   2. Normalized directory names for packages
   3. New-style `spack.package` imports

See #50507, #50579, and #50594 for more.

## Compiler dependencies

Prior to `v1.0`, compilers in Spack were attributes on nodes in the spec graph, with a
name and a version (e.g., `gcc@12.0.0`). In `v1.0` compilers are packages like any other
package in Spack (see #45189). This means that they can have variants, targets, and
other attributes that regular nodes have.

Here, we list the major changes that users should be aware of for this new model.

### Compiler configuration

In Spack `v1.0`, `compilers.yaml` is deprecated. `compilers.yaml` is still read by
Spack, if present. We will continue to support this for at least a year, but we may
remove it after that. Users are encouraged to migrate their configuration to use
`packages.yaml` instead.

Old style `compilers.yaml` specification:

```yaml
compilers:
  - compiler:
      spec: gcc@12.3.1
      paths:
         c: /usr/bin/gcc
         cxx: /usr/bin/g++
         fc: /usr/bin/gfortran
       modules: [...]
```

New style `packages.yaml` compiler specification:

```yaml
packages:
  gcc:
    externals:
    - spec: gcc@12.3.1+binutils
      prefix: /usr
      extra_attributes:
        compilers:
          c: /usr/bin/gcc
          cxx: /usr/bin/g++
          fc: /usr/bin/gfortran
        modules: [...]
```

See
[Configuring Compilers](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuring_compilers.html)
for more details.


### Languages are virtual dependencies

Packages that need a C, C++, or Fortran compiler now **must** depend on `c`, `cxx`, or
`fortran` as a build dependency, e.g.:

```python
class MyPackage(Package):
    depends_on("c", type="build")
    depends_on("cxx", type="build")
    depends_on("fortran", type="build")
```

Historically, Spack assumed that *every* package was compiled with C, C++, and Fortran.
In Spack `v1.0`, we allow packages to simply not have a compiler if they do not need
one. For example, pure Python packages would not depend on any of these, and you should
not add these dependencies to packages that do not need them.

[Spack `v0.23`](https://github.com/spack/spack/releases/tag/v0.23.0) introduced language
virtual dependencies, and we have back-ported them to `0.21.3` and `v0.22.2`. In pre-1.0
Spack releases, these are a no-op. They are present so that language dependencies do not
cause an error. This allows you to more easily use older Spack versions together with
`v1.0`.

See #45217 for more details.

### The meaning of `%` has changed

In Spack `v0.x`, `%` specified a compiler with a name and an optional version. In Spack
`v1.0`, it simply means "direct dependency". It is similar to the caret `^`, which means
"direct *or* transitive dependency".

Unlike `^`, which specifies a dependency that needs to be unified for the whole graph,
`%` can specify direct dependencies of particular nodes. This means you can use it to
mix and match compilers, or `cmake` versions, or any other package for which *multiple*
versions of the same build dependency are needed in the same graph. For example, in this
spec:

```
foo ^hdf5 %cmake@3.1.2 ^zlib-ng %cmake@3.2.4
```

`hdf5` and `zlib-ng` are both transitive dependencies of `foo`, but `hdf5` will be built
with `cmake@3.1.2` and `zlib-ng` will be built with `%cmake@3.2.4`. This is similar to
mixing compilers, but you can now use `%` with other types of build dependencies, as
well. You can have multiple versions of packages in the same graph, as long as they are
purely build dependencies.

### Virtual assignment syntax

You can still specify compilers with `foo %gcc`, in which case `gcc` will be used to
satisfy any `c`, `cxx`, and `fortran` dependencies of `foo`, but you can also be
specific about the compiler that should be used for each language. To mix, e.g., `clang`
and `gfortran`, you can now use *virtual assignment* like so:

```console
spack install foo %c,cxx=gcc %fortran=gfortran
```

This says to use `gcc` for `c` and `cxx`, and `gfortran` for `fortran`.
It is functionally equivalent to the already supported edge attribute syntax:

```
spack install foo %[virtuals=c,cxx] gcc %[virtuals=fortran] gfortran
```

But, virtual assignment is more legible. We use it as the default formatting for virtual
edge attributes, and we print it in the output of `spack spec`, `spack find`, etc. For
example:

```console
> spack spec zlib
 -   zlib@1.3.1+optimize+pic+shared build_system=makefile arch=darwin-sequoia-m1 %c,cxx=apple-clang@16.0.0
[e]      ^apple-clang@16.0.0 build_system=bundle arch=darwin-sequoia-m1
 -       ^compiler-wrapper@1.0 build_system=generic arch=darwin-sequoia-m1
[+]      ^gmake@4.4.1~guile build_system=generic arch=darwin-sequoia-m1 %c=apple-clang@16.0.0
[+]          ^compiler-wrapper@1.0 build_system=generic arch=darwin-sequoia-m1
```

You can see above that only `zlib` and `gmake` are compiled, and `gmake` uses only `c`.
The other nodes are either external, and we cannot detect the compiler (`apple-clang`)
or they are not compiled (`compiler-wrapper` is a shell script).

### Toolchains

Spack now has a concept of a "toolchain", which can be configured in `toolchains.yaml`.
A toolchain is an alias for common dependencies, flags, and other spec properties that
you can attach to a node in a graph with `%`.

Toolchains are versatile and composable as they are simply aliases for regular specs.
You can use them to represent mixed compiler combinations, compiler/MPI/numerical
library groups, particular runtime libraries, and flags -- all to be applied together.
This allows you to do with compiler dependencies what we used to do with
`compilers.yaml`, and more.

Example mixed clang/gfortran toolchain:

```yaml
toolchains:
  clang_gfortran:
    - spec: %c=clang
      when: %c
    - spec: %cxx=clang
      when: %cxx
    - spec: %fortran=gcc
      when: %fortran
    - spec: cflags="-O3 -g"
    - spec: cxxflags="-O3 -g"
    - spec: fflags="-O3 -g"
```

This enables you to write `spack install foo %clang_gfortran`, and Spack will resolve
the `%clang_gfortran` toolchain to include the dependencies and flags listed in
`toolchains.yaml`.

You could also couple the intel compilers with `mvapich2` like so:

```yaml
toolchains:
  intel_mvapich2:
    - spec: %c=intel-oneapi-compilers @2025.1.1
      when: %c
    - spec: %cxx=intel-oneapi-compilers @2025.1.1
      when: %cxx
    - spec: %fortran=intel-oneapi-compilers @2025.1.1
      when: %fortran
    - spec: %mpi=mvapich2 @2.3.7-1 +cuda
      when: %mpi
```

The `when:` conditions here ensure that toolchain constraints are only applied when
needed. See the
[toolchains documentation](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced_topics.html#defining-and-using-toolchains)
or #50481 for details.

### Ordering of variants and compilers now matters

In Spack `v0.x`, these two specs parse the same:

```
pkg %gcc +foo
pkg +foo %gcc
```

The `+foo` variant applies to `pkg` in either case. In Spack `v1.0`, there is a breaking
change, and `+foo` in `pkg %gcc +foo` now applies to `gcc`, since `gcc` is a normal
package. This ensures we have the following symmetry:

```
pkg +foo %dep +bar  # `pkg +foo` depends on `dep +bar` directly
pkg +foo ^dep +bar  # `pkg +foo` depends on `dep +bar` directly or transitively
```

In Spack `v1.0` you may get errors at concretization time if `+foo` is not a variant of
`gcc` in specs like`%pkg %gcc +foo`.

You can use the `spack style --spec-strings` command to update `package.py` files,
`spack.yaml` files:

  ```shell
  # dry run
  spack style --spec-strings $(git ls-files)  # if you have a git repo
  spack style --spec-strings spack.yaml  # environments
  ```

  ```shell
  # use --fix to perform the changes listed by the dry run
  spack style --fix --spec-strings $(git ls-files)
  spack style --fix --spec-strings spack.yaml
  ```

  See #49808, #49438, #49439 for details.

## Additional Major Features

### Concurrent Package Builds

This release has completely reworked Spack's build scheduler, and it adds a `-p`/
`--concurrent-packages` argument to `spack install`, which can greatly accelerate builds
with many packages. You can use it in combination with `spack install -j`. For example,
this command:

```
spack install -p 4 -j 16
```

runs up to 4 package builds at once, each with up to 16 make jobs. The default for
`--concurrent-packages` is currently 1, so you must enable this feature yourself, either
on the command line or by setting `config:concurrent_packages` (#50856):

```yaml
config:
  concurrent_packages: 1
```

As before, you can run `spack install` on multiple nodes in a cluster, if the filesystem
where Spack's `install_tree` is located supports locking.

We will make concurrent package builds the default in `1.1`, when we plan to include
support for `gmake`'s jobserver protocol and for line-synced output. Currently, setting
`-p` higher than 1 can make Spack's output difficult to read.

### Content-addressed build caches

Spack `v1.0` changes the format of build caches to address a number of scaling and
consistency issues with our old (aging) buildcache layout. The new buildcache format is
content-addressed and enables us to make many operations atomic (and therefore safer).
It is also more extensible than the old buildcache format and can enable features like
split debug info and different signing methods in the future. See #48713 for more
details.

Spack `v1.0` can still read, but not write to, the old build caches. The new build cache
format is *not* backward compatible with the old format, *but* you can have a new build
cache and an old build cache coexist beside each other. If you push to an old build
cache, new binaries will start to show up in the new format.

You can migrate an old buildcache to the new format using the `spack buildcache migrate`
command. It is nondestructive and can migrate an old build cache to a new one in-place.
That is, it creates the new buildcache within the same directory, alongside the old
buildcache.

As with other major changes, the old buildcache format is deprecated in `v1.0`, but will
not be removed for at least a year.

### Better provenance and mirroring for git

Spack now resolves and preserves the commit of any git-based version at concretization
time, storing the precise commit built on the Spec in a reserved `commit` variant. This
allows us to better reproduce git builds. See #48702 for details.

Historically, Spack has only stored the ref name, e.g. the branch or tag, for git
versions that did not already contain full commits. Now we can know exactly what was
built regardless of how it was fetched.

As a consequence of this change, mirroring git repositories is also more robust. See
#50604, #50906 for details.

### Environment variables in environments

You can now specify environment variables in your environment that should be set on
activation (and unset on deactivation):

```yaml
spack:
  specs:
    - cmake%gcc
  env_vars:
    set:
      MY_FAVORITE_VARIABLE: "TRUE"
```

The syntax allows the same modifications that are allowed for modules: `set:`, `unset:`,
`prepend_path:`, `append_path:`, etc.

See [the docs](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/env_vars_yaml.html or #47587 for more.

### Better include functionality

Spack allows you to include local or remote configuration files through `include.yaml`,
and includes can be optional (i.e. include them only if they exist) or conditional (only
include them under certain conditions:

```yaml
spack:
  include:
  - /path/to/a/required/config.yaml
  - path: /path/to/$os/$target/config
    optional: true
  - path: /path/to/os-specific/config-dir
    when: os == "ventura"
```

You can use this in an environment, or in an `include.yaml` in an existing configuration
scope. Included configuration files are required *unless* they are explicitly optional
or the entry's condition evaluates to `false`. Optional includes are specified with the
`optional` clause and conditional ones with the ``when`` clause.

Conditionals use the same syntax as
[spec list references](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments.html#spec-list-references)
The [docs on `include.yaml`](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/include_yaml.html)
have more information. You can also look at #48784.


## New commands and options
* `spack repo update` will pull the latest packages (#50868, #50997)
* `spack style --spec-strings` fixes old configuration file and packages (#49485)
* `spack repo migrate`: migrates old repositories to the new layout (#50507)
* `spack ci` no longer has a `--keep-stage` flag (#49467)
* The new `spack config scopes` subcommand will list active configuration scopes (#41455, #50703)
* `spack cd --repo <namespace>` (#50845)
* `spack location --repo <namespace>` (#50845)
* `--force` is now a common argument for all commands that do concretization (#48838)

## Notable refactors

* All of Spack is now in one top-level `spack` Python package
  * The `spack_installable` package is gone as it's no longer needed (#50996)
  * The top-level `llnl` package has been moved to `spack.llnl` and will likely be
    refactored more later (#50989)
  * Vendored dependencies that were previously in `_vendoring` are now in `spack.vendor` (#51005)

* Increased determinism when generating inputs for the ASP solver, leading to more
  consistent concretization results (#49471)

* Added fast, stable spec comparison, which also increases determinism of concretizer
  inputs, and more consistent results (#50625)

* Test deps are now part of the DAG hash, so builds with tests enabled will (correctly)
  have different hashes from builds without tests enabled (#48936)

* `spack spec` in an environment or on the command line will show unified output with
  the specs provided as roots (#47574)

* users can now set a timeout in `concretizer.yaml` in case they frequently hit long
  solves (#47661)

* GoPackage: respect `-j`` concurrency (#48421)

* We are using static analysis to speed up concretization (#48729)

## Documentation

We have overhauled a number of sections of the documentation.

* The basics section of the documentation has been reorganized and updated (#50932)

* The [packaging guide](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide_creation.html)
  has been rewritten and broken into four separate, logically ordered sections (#50884).

* As mentioned above the entire
  [`spack.package` API](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/package_api.html) has
  been documented and consolidated to one package (#51010)

## Notable Bugfixes

* A race that would cause timeouts in certain parallel builds has been fixed. Every
  build now stages its own patches and cannot fight over them (causing a timeout) with
  other builds (#50697)
* The `command_line` scope is now *always* the top level. Previously environments could
  override command line settings (#48255)
* `setup-env.csh` is now hardened to avoid conflicts with user aliases (#49670)

## Additional deprecations, removals, and breaking changes

1. `spec["pkg"]` searches only direct dependencies and transitive link/run dependencies,
   ordered by depth. This avoids situations where we pick up unwanted deps of build/test
   deps. To reach those, you need to do `spec["build_dep"]["pkg"]` explicitly (#49016).

2. `spec["mpi"]` no longer works to refer to `spec` itself on specs like `openmpi` and
   `mpich` that could provide `mpi`. We only find `"mpi"` if it is provided by some
   dependency (see #48984).

3. We have removed some long-standing internal API methods on `spack.spec.Spec` so that
   we can decouple internal modules in the Spack code. `spack.spec` was including too
   many different parts of Spack.
  * `Spec.concretize()` and `Spec.concretized()` have been removed. Use
    `spack.concretize.concretize_one(spec)` instead (#47971, #47978)
  * `Spec.is_virtual`` is now spack.repo.PATH.is_virtual (#48986)
  * `Spec.virtual_dependencies` has been removed (#49079)

4. #50603: Platform config scopes are now opt-in. If you want to use subdirectories like
   `darwin` or `linux` in your scopes, you'll need to include them explicitly in an
   `include.yaml` or in your `spack.yaml` file, like so:

    ```yaml
    include:
      - include: "${platform}"
        optional: true
    ```

5. #48488, #48502: buildcache entries created with Spack 0.19 and older using `spack
   buildcache create --rel` will no longer be relocated upon install. These old binaries
   should continue to work, except when they are installed with different
   `config:install_tree:projections` compared to what they were built with. Similarly,
   buildcache entries created with Spack 0.15 and older that contain long shebang lines
   wrapped with sbang will no longer be relocated.

6. #50462: the `package.py` globals `std_cmake_args`, `std_pip_args`, `std_meson_args`
   were removed. They were deprecated in Spack 0.23. Use `CMakeBuilder.std_args(pkg)`,
   `PythonPipBuilder.std_args(pkg)` and `MesonBuilder.std_args(pkg)` instead.

7. #50605, #50616: If you were using `update_external_dependencies()` in your private
   packages, note that it is going away in 1.0 to get it out of the package API. It is
   instead being moved into the concretizer, where it can change in the future, when we
   have a better way to deal with dependencies of externals, without breaking the
   package API. We suspect that nobody was doing this, but it's technically a breaking
   change.

8. #48838: Two breaking command changes:
    * `spack install` no longer has a `-f` / `--file` option --
      write `spack install ./path/to/spec.json` instead.
    * `spack mirror create` no longer has a short `-f` option --
      use `spack mirror create --file` instead.

9. We no longer support the PGI compilers. They have been replaced by `nvhpc` (#47195)

10. Python 3.8 is deprecated in the Python package, as it is EOL (#46913)

11. The `target=fe` / `target=frontend` and `target=be` / `target=backend` targets from
    Spack's orignal compilation model for cross-compiled Cray and BlueGene systems are
    now deprecated (#47756)

# v0.23.0 (2024-11-13)

`v0.23.0` is a major feature release.

We are planning to make this the last major release before Spack `v1.0`
in June 2025. Alongside `v0.23`, we will be making pre-releases (alpha,
beta, etc.)  of `v1.0`, and we encourage users to try them and send us
feedback, either on GitHub or on Slack. You can track the road to
`v1.0` here:

  * https://github.com/spack/spack/releases
  * https://github.com/spack/spack/discussions/30634

## Features in this Release

1. **Language virtuals**

   Your packages can now explicitly depend on the languages they require.
   Historically, Spack has considered C, C++, and Fortran compiler
   dependencies to be implicit. In `v0.23`, you should ensure that
   new packages add relevant C, C++, and Fortran dependencies like this:

   ```python
   depends_on("c", type="build")
   depends_on("cxx", type="build")
   depends_on("fortran", type="build")
   ```

   We encourage you to add these annotations to your packages now, to prepare
   for Spack `v1.0.0`. In `v1.0.0`, these annotations will be necessary for
   your package to use C, C++, and Fortran compilers. Note that you should
   *not* add language dependencies to packages that don't need them, e.g.,
   pure python packages.

   We have already auto-generated these dependencies for packages in the
   `builtin` repository (see #45217), based on the types of source files
   present in each package's source code. We *may* have added too many or too
   few language dependencies, so please submit pull requests to correct
   packages if you find that the language dependencies are incorrect.

   Note that we have also backported support for these dependencies to
   `v0.21.3` and `v0.22.2`, to make all of them forward-compatible with
   `v0.23`. This should allow you to move easily between older and newer Spack
   releases without breaking your packages.

2. **Spec splicing**

   We are working to make binary installation more seamless in Spack. `v0.23`
   introduces "splicing", which allows users to deploy binaries using local,
   optimized versions of a binary interface, even if they were not built with
   that interface. For example, this would allow you to build binaries in the
   cloud using `mpich` and install them on a system using a local, optimized
   version of `mvapich2` *without rebuilding*. Spack preserves full provenance
   for the installed packages and knows that they were built one way but
   deployed another.

   Our intent is to leverage this across many key HPC binary packages,
   e.g. MPI, CUDA, ROCm, and libfabric.

   Fundamentally, splicing allows Spack to redeploy an existing spec with
   different dependencies than how it was built. There are two interfaces to
   splicing.

   a. Explicit Splicing

      #39136 introduced the explicit splicing interface. In the
      concretizer config, you can specify a target spec and a replacement
      by hash.

      ```yaml
      concretizer:
        splice:
          explicit:
          - target: mpi
            replacement: mpich/abcdef
      ```

      Here, every installation that would normally use the target spec will
      instead use its replacement. Above, any spec using *any* `mpi` will be
      spliced to depend on the specific `mpich` installation requested. This
      *can* go wrong if you try to replace something built with, e.g.,
      `openmpi` with `mpich`, and it is on the user to ensure ABI
      compatibility between target and replacement specs. This currently
      requires some expertise to use, but it will allow users to reuse the
      binaries they create across more machines and environments.

   b. Automatic Splicing (experimental)

      #46729 introduced automatic splicing. In the concretizer config, enable
      automatic splicing:

      ```yaml
      concretizer:
        splice:
          automatic: true
      ```

      or run:

      ```console
      spack config add concretizer:splice:automatic:true
      ```

      The concretizer will select splices for ABI compatibility to maximize
      package reuse. Packages can denote ABI compatibility using the
      `can_splice` directive. No packages in Spack yet use this directive, so
      if you want to use this feature you will need to add `can_splice`
      annotations to your packages. We are working on ways to add more ABI
      compatibility information to the Spack package repository, and this
      directive may change in the future.

   See the documentation for more details:
   * https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_settings.html#splicing
   * https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html#specifying-abi-compatibility

3. Broader variant propagation

   Since #42931, you can specify propagated variants like `hdf5
   build_type==RelWithDebInfo` or `trilinos ++openmp` to propagate a variant
   to all dependencies for which it is relevant. This is valid *even* if the
   variant does not exist on the package or its dependencies.

   See https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html#variants.

4. Query specs by namespace

   #45416 allows a package's namespace (indicating the repository it came from)
   to be treated like a variant. You can request packages from particular repos
   like this:

   ```console
   spack find zlib namespace=builtin
   spack find zlib namespace=myrepo
   ```

   Previously, the spec syntax only allowed namespaces to be prefixes of spec
   names, e.g. `builtin.zlib`. The previous syntax still works.

5. `spack spec` respects environment settings and `unify:true`

   `spack spec` did not previously respect environment lockfiles or
   unification settings, which made it difficult to see exactly how a spec
   would concretize within an environment. Now it does, so the output you get
   with `spack spec` will be *the same* as what your environment will
   concretize to when you run `spack concretize`. Similarly, if you provide
   multiple specs on the command line with `spack spec`, it will concretize
   them together if `unify:true` is set.

   See #47556 and #44843.

6. Less noisy `spack spec` output

   `spack spec` previously showed output like this:

   ```console
    > spack spec /v5fn6xo
    Input spec
    --------------------------------
     -   /v5fn6xo

    Concretized
    --------------------------------
    [+]  openssl@3.3.1%apple-clang@16.0.0~docs+shared arch=darwin-sequoia-m1
    ...
   ```

   But the input spec is redundant, and we know we run `spack spec` to concretize
   the input spec. `spack spec` now *only* shows the concretized spec. See #47574.

7. Better output for `spack find -c`

   In an environmnet, `spack find -c` lets you search the concretized, but not
   yet installed, specs, just as you would the installed ones. As with `spack
   spec`, this should make it easier for you to see what *will* be built
   before building and installing it. See #44713.

8. `spack -C <env>`: use an environment's configuration without activation

   Spack environments allow you to associate:
   1. a set of (possibly concretized) specs, and
   2. configuration

   When you activate an environment, you're using both of these. Previously, we
   supported:
   * `spack -e <env>` to run spack in the context of a specific environment, and
   * `spack -C <directory>` to run spack using a directory with configuration files.

   You can now also pass an environment to `spack -C` to use *only* the environment's
   configuration, but not the specs or lockfile. See #45046.

## New commands, options, and directives

* The new `spack env track` command (#41897) takes a non-managed Spack
  environment and adds a symlink to Spack's `$environments_root` directory, so
  that it will be included for reference counting for commands like `spack
  uninstall` and `spack gc`. If you use free-standing directory environments,
  this is useful for preventing Spack from removing things required by your
  environments. You can undo this tracking with the `spack env untrack`
  command.

* Add `-t` short option for `spack --backtrace` (#47227)

  `spack -d / --debug` enables backtraces on error, but it can be very
  verbose, and sometimes you just want the backtrace. `spack -t / --backtrace`
  provides that option.

* `gc`: restrict to specific specs (#46790)

  If you only want to garbage-collect specific packages, you can now provide
  them on the command line. This gives users finer-grained control over what
  is uninstalled.

* oci buildcaches now support `--only=package`. You can now push *just* a
  package and not its dependencies to an OCI registry. This allows dependents
  of non-redistributable specs to be stored in OCI registries without an
  error. See #45775.

## Notable refactors
* Variants are now fully conditional

  The `variants` dictionary on packages was previously keyed by variant name,
  and allowed only one definition of any given variant. Spack is now smart
  enough to understand that variants may have different values and defaults
  for different versions. For example, `warpx` prior to `23.06` only supported
  builds for one dimensionality, and newer `warpx` versions could be built
  with support for many different dimensions:

  ```python
  variant(
      "dims",
      default="3",
      values=("1", "2", "3", "rz"),
      multi=False,
      description="Number of spatial dimensions",
      when="@:23.05",
  )
  variant(
      "dims",
      default="1,2,rz,3",
      values=("1", "2", "3", "rz"),
      multi=True,
      description="Number of spatial dimensions",
      when="@23.06:",
  )
  ```

  Previously, the default for the old version of `warpx` was not respected and
  had to be specified manually. Now, Spack will select the right variant
  definition for each version at concretization time. This allows variants to
  evolve more smoothly over time. See #44425 for details.

## Highlighted bugfixes

1. Externals no longer override the preferred provider (#45025).

   External definitions could interfere with package preferences. Now, if
   `openmpi` is the preferred `mpi`, and an external `mpich` is defined, a new
   `openmpi` *will* be built if building it is possible. Previously we would
   prefer `mpich` despite the preference.

2. Composable `cflags` (#41049).

   This release fixes a longstanding bug that concretization would fail if
   there were different `cflags` specified in `packages.yaml`,
   `compilers.yaml`, or on `the` CLI. Flags and their ordering are now tracked
   in the concretizer and flags from multiple sources will be merged.

3. Fix concretizer Unification for included environments (#45139).

## Deprecations, removals, and syntax changes

1. The old concretizer has been removed from Spack, along with the
   `config:concretizer` config option. Spack will emit a warning if the option
   is present in user configuration, since it now has no effect. Spack now
   uses a simpler bootstrapping mechanism, where a JSON prototype is tweaked
   slightly to get an initial concrete spec to download. See #45215.

2. Best-effort expansion of spec matrices has been removed. This feature did
   not work with the "new" ASP-based concretizer, and did not work with
   `unify: True` or `unify: when_possible`. Use the
   [exclude key](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments.html#spec-matrices)
   for the environment to exclude invalid components, or use multiple spec
   matrices to combine the list of specs for which the constraint is valid and
   the list of specs for which it is not. See #40792.

3. The old Cray `platform` (based on Cray PE modules) has been removed, and
   `platform=cray` is no longer supported. Since `v0.19`, Spack has handled
   Cray machines like Linux clusters with extra packages, and we have
   encouraged using this option to support Cray. The new approach allows us to
   correctly handle Cray machines with non-SLES operating systems, and it is
   much more reliable than making assumptions about Cray modules. See the
   `v0.19` release notes and #43796 for more details.

4. The `config:install_missing_compilers` config option has been deprecated,
   and it is a no-op when set in `v0.23`. Our new compiler dependency model
   will replace it with a much more reliable and robust mechanism in `v1.0`.
   See #46237.

5. Config options that deprecated in `v0.21` have been removed in `v0.23`. You
   can now only specify preferences for `compilers`, `targets`, and
   `providers` globally via the `packages:all:` section. Similarly, you can
   only specify `versions:` locally for a specific package. See #44061 and
   #31261 for details.

6. Spack's old test interface has been removed (#45752), having been
   deprecated in `v0.22.0` (#34236). All `builtin` packages have been updated
   to use the new interface. See the [stand-alone test documentation](
   https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html#stand-alone-tests)

7. The `spack versions --safe-only` option, deprecated since `v0.21.0`, has
   been removed. See #45765.

* The `--dependencies` and `--optimize` arguments to `spack ci` have been
  deprecated. See #45005.

## Binary caches
1. Public binary caches now include an ML stack for Linux/aarch64 (#39666)We
   now build an ML stack for Linux/aarch64 for all pull requests and on
   develop. The ML stack includes both CPU-only and CUDA builds for Horovod,
   Hugging Face, JAX, Keras, PyTorch,scikit-learn, TensorBoard, and
   TensorFlow, and related packages. The CPU-only stack also includes XGBoost.
   See https://cache.spack.io/tag/develop/?stack=ml-linux-aarch64-cuda.

2. There is also now an stack of developer tools for macOS (#46910), which is
   analogous to the Linux devtools stack. You can use this to avoid building
   many common build dependencies. See
   https://cache.spack.io/tag/develop/?stack=developer-tools-darwin.

## Architecture support
* archspec has been updated to `v0.2.5`, with support for `zen5`
* Spack's CUDA package now supports the Grace Hopper `9.0a` compute capability (#45540)

* Windows bootstrapping: `file` and `gpg` (#41810)
* `scripts` directory added to PATH on Windows for python extensions (#45427)

# v0.22.0 (2024-05-12)

`v0.22.0` is a major feature release.

## Features in this release

1. **Compiler dependencies**

    We are in the process of making compilers proper dependencies in Spack, and a number
    of changes in `v0.22` support that effort. You may notice nodes in your dependency
    graphs for compiler runtime libraries like `gcc-runtime` or `libgfortran`, and you
    may notice that Spack graphs now include `libc`. We've also begun moving compiler
    configuration from `compilers.yaml` to `packages.yaml` to make it consistent with
    other externals. We are trying to do this with the least disruption possible, so
    your existing `compilers.yaml` files should still work. We expect to be done with
    this transition by the `v0.23` release in November.

    * #41104: Packages compiled with `%gcc` on Linux, macOS and FreeBSD now depend on a
      new package `gcc-runtime`, which contains a copy of the shared compiler runtime
      libraries. This enables gcc runtime libraries to be installed and relocated when
      using a build cache. When building minimal Spack-generated container images it is
      no longer necessary to install libgfortran, libgomp etc. using the system package
      manager.

    * #42062: Packages compiled with `%oneapi` now depend on a new package
      `intel-oneapi-runtime`. This is similar to `gcc-runtime`, and the runtimes can
      provide virtuals and compilers can inject dependencies on virtuals into compiled
      packages. This allows us to model library soname compatibility and allows
      compilers like `%oneapi` to provide virtuals like `sycl` (which can also be
      provided by standalone libraries). Note that until we have an agreement in place
      with intel, Intel packages are marked `redistribute(source=False, binary=False)`
      and must be downloaded outside of Spack.

    * #43272: changes to the optimization criteria of the solver improve the hit-rate of
      buildcaches by a fair amount. The solver more relaxed compatibility rules and will
      not try to strictly match compilers or targets of reused specs. Users can still
      enforce the previous strict behavior with `require:` sections in `packages.yaml`.
      Note that to enforce correct linking, Spack will *not* reuse old `%gcc` and
      `%oneapi` specs that do not have the runtime libraries as a dependency.

    * #43539: Spack will reuse specs built with compilers that are *not* explicitly
      configured in `compilers.yaml`. Because we can now keep runtime libraries in build
      cache, we do not require you to also have a local configured compiler to *use* the
      runtime libraries. This improves reuse in buildcaches and avoids conflicts with OS
      updates that happen underneath Spack.

    * #43190: binary compatibility on `linux` is now based on the `libc` version,
      instead of on the `os` tag. Spack builds now detect the host `libc` (`glibc` or
      `musl`) and add it as an implicit external node in the dependency graph. Binaries
      with a `libc` with the same name and a version less than or equal to that of the
      detected `libc` can be reused. This is only on `linux`, not `macos` or `Windows`.

    * #43464: each package that can provide a compiler is now detectable using `spack
      external find`. External packages defining compiler paths are effectively used as
      compilers, and `spack external find -t compiler` can be used as a substitute for
      `spack compiler find`. More details on this transition are in
      [the docs](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#manual-compiler-configuration)

2. **Improved `spack find` UI for Environments**

   If you're working in an environment, you likely care about:

   * What are the roots
   * Which ones are installed / not installed
   * What's been added that still needs to be concretized

    We've tweaked `spack find` in environments to show this information much more
    clearly. Installation status is shown next to each root, so you can see what is
    installed. Roots are also shown in bold in the list of installed packages. There is
    also a new option for `spack find -r` / `--only-roots` that will only show env
    roots, if you don't want to look at all the installed specs.

    More details in #42334.

3. **Improved command-line string quoting**

   We are making some breaking changes to how Spack parses specs on the CLI in order to
   respect shell quoting instead of trying to fight it. If you (sadly) had to write
   something like this on the command line:

    ```
    spack install zlib cflags=\"-O2 -g\"
    ```

    That will now result in an error, but you can now write what you probably expected
    to work in the first place:

    ```
    spack install zlib cflags="-O2 -g"
    ```

    Quoted can also now include special characters, so you can supply flags like:

    ```
    spack install zlib ldflags='-Wl,-rpath=$ORIGIN/_libs'
    ```

    To reduce ambiguity in parsing, we now require that you *not* put spaces around `=`
    and `==` when for flags or variants. This would not have broken before but will now
    result in an error:

    ```
    spack install zlib cflags = "-O2 -g"
    ```

    More details and discussion in #30634.

4. **Revert default `spack install` behavior to `--reuse`**

   We changed the default concretizer behavior from `--reuse` to `--reuse-deps` in
   #30990 (in `v0.20`), which meant that *every* `spack install` invocation would
   attempt to build a new version of the requested package / any environment roots.
   While this is a common ask for *upgrading* and for *developer* workflows, we don't
   think it should be the default for a package manager.

   We are going to try to stick to this policy:
   1. Prioritize reuse and build as little as possible by default.
   2. Only upgrade or install duplicates if they are explicitly asked for, or if there
      is a known security issue that necessitates an upgrade.

   With the install command you now have three options:

   * `--reuse` (default): reuse as many existing installations as possible.
   * `--reuse-deps` / `--fresh-roots`: upgrade (freshen) roots but reuse dependencies if possible.
   * `--fresh`: install fresh versions of requested packages (roots) and their dependencies.

   We've also introduced `--fresh-roots` as an alias for `--reuse-deps` to make it more clear
   that it may give you fresh versions. More details in #41302 and #43988.

5. **More control over reused specs**

   You can now control which packages to reuse and how. There is a new
   `concretizer:reuse` config option, which accepts the following properties:

   - `roots`: `true` to reuse roots, `false` to reuse just dependencies
   - `exclude`: list of constraints used to select which specs *not* to reuse
   - `include`: list of constraints used to select which specs *to* reuse
   - `from`: list of sources for reused specs (some combination of `local`,
     `buildcache`, or `external`)

   For example, to reuse only specs compiled with GCC, you could write:

   ```yaml
   concretizer:
      reuse:
        roots: true
        include:
        - "%gcc"
   ```

   Or, if `openmpi` must be used from externals, and it must be the only external used:

   ```yaml
   concretizer:
     reuse:
       roots: true
       from:
       - type: local
         exclude: ["openmpi"]
       - type: buildcache
         exclude: ["openmpi"]
       - type: external
         include: ["openmpi"]
   ```

6. **New `redistribute()` directive**

   Some packages can't be redistributed in source or binary form. We need an explicit
   way to say that in a package.

   Now there is a `redistribute()` directive so that package authors can write:

   ```python
   class MyPackage(Package):
       redistribute(source=False, binary=False)
   ```

   Like other directives, this works with `when=`:

   ```python
   class MyPackage(Package):
       # 12.0 and higher are proprietary
       redistribute(source=False, binary=False, when="@12.0:")

       # can't redistribute when we depend on some proprietary dependency
       redistribute(source=False, binary=False, when="^proprietary-dependency")
   ```

    More in #20185.

7. **New `conflict:` and `prefer:` syntax for package preferences**

   Previously, you could express conflicts and preferences in `packages.yaml` through
   some contortions with `require:`:

    ```yaml
    packages:
      zlib-ng:
        require:
        - one_of: ["%clang", "@:"]   # conflict on %clang
        - any_of: ["+shared", "@:"]  # strong preference for +shared
    ```

    You can now use `require:` and `prefer:` for a much more readable configuration:

    ```yaml
    packages:
      zlib-ng:
        conflict:
        - "%clang"
        prefer:
        - "+shared"
    ```

    See [the documentation](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packages_yaml.html#conflicts-and-strong-preferences)
    and #41832 for more details.

8. **`include_concrete` in environments**

   You may want to build on the *concrete* contents of another environment without
   changing that environment.  You can now include the concrete specs from another
   environment's `spack.lock` with `include_concrete`:

   ```yaml
      spack:
        specs: []
        concretizer:
            unify: true
        include_concrete:
        - /path/to/environment1
        - /path/to/environment2
   ```

   Now, when *this* environment is concretized, it will bring in the already concrete
   specs from `environment1` and `environment2`, and build on top of them without
   changing them. This is useful if you have phased deployments, where old deployments
   should not be modified but you want to use as many of them as possible. More details
   in #33768.

9. **`python-venv` isolation**

   Spack has unique requirements for Python because it:
    1. installs every package in its own independent directory, and
    2. allows users to register *external* python installations.

   External installations may contain their own installed packages that can interfere
   with Spack installations, and some distributions (Debian and Ubuntu) even change the
   `sysconfig` in ways that alter the installation layout of installed Python packages
   (e.g., with the addition of a `/local` prefix on Debian or Ubuntu). To isolate Spack
   from these and other issues, we now insert a small `python-venv` package in between
   `python` and packages that need to install Python code. This isolates Spack's build
   environment, isolates Spack from any issues with an external python, and resolves a
   large number of issues we've had with Python installations.

   See #40773 for further details.

# v0.21.0 (2023-11-11)

`v0.21.0` is a major feature release.

## Features in this release

1. **Better error messages with condition chaining**

   In v0.18, we added better error messages that could tell you what problem happened,
   but they couldn't tell you *why* it happened. `0.21` adds *condition chaining* to the
   solver, and Spack can now trace back through the conditions that led to an error and
   build a tree of causes potential causes and where they came from. For example:

   ```console
   $ spack solve hdf5 ^cmake@3.0.1
   ==> Error: concretization failed for the following reasons:

      1. Cannot satisfy 'cmake@3.0.1'
      2. Cannot satisfy 'cmake@3.0.1'
           required because hdf5 ^cmake@3.0.1 requested from CLI
      3. Cannot satisfy 'cmake@3.18:' and 'cmake@3.0.1
           required because hdf5 ^cmake@3.0.1 requested from CLI
           required because hdf5 depends on cmake@3.18: when @1.13:
             required because hdf5 ^cmake@3.0.1 requested from CLI
      4. Cannot satisfy 'cmake@3.12:' and 'cmake@3.0.1
           required because hdf5 depends on cmake@3.12:
             required because hdf5 ^cmake@3.0.1 requested from CLI
           required because hdf5 ^cmake@3.0.1 requested from CLI
   ```

   More details in #40173.

2. **OCI build caches**

   You can now use an arbitrary [OCI](https://opencontainers.org) registry as a build
   cache:

   ```console
   $ spack mirror add my_registry oci://user/image # Dockerhub
   $ spack mirror add my_registry oci://ghcr.io/haampie/spack-test # GHCR
   $ spack mirror set --push --oci-username ... --oci-password ... my_registry  # set login creds
   $ spack buildcache push my_registry [specs...]
   ```

   And you can optionally add a base image to get *runnable* images:

   ```console
   $ spack buildcache push --base-image ubuntu:23.04 my_registry python
   Pushed ... as [image]:python-3.11.2-65txfcpqbmpawclvtasuog4yzmxwaoia.spack

   $ docker run --rm -it [image]:python-3.11.2-65txfcpqbmpawclvtasuog4yzmxwaoia.spack
   ```

   This creates a container image from the Spack installations on the host system,
   without the need to run `spack install` from a `Dockerfile` or `sif` file. It also
   addresses the inconvenience of losing binaries of dependencies when `RUN spack
   install` fails inside `docker build`.

   Further, the container image layers and build cache tarballs are the same files. This
   means that `spack install` and `docker pull` use the exact same underlying binaries.
   If you previously used `spack install` inside of `docker build`, this feature helps
   you save storage by a factor two.

   More details in #38358.

3. **Multiple versions of build dependencies**

   Increasingly, complex package builds require multiple versions of some build
   dependencies. For example, Python packages frequently require very specific versions
   of `setuptools`, `cython`, and sometimes different physics packages require different
   versions of Python to build. The concretizer enforced that every solve was *unified*,
   i.e., that there only be one version of every package. The concretizer now supports
   "duplicate" nodes for *build dependencies*, but enforces unification through
   transitive link and run dependencies. This will allow it to better resolve complex
   dependency graphs in ecosystems like Python, and it also gets us very close to
   modeling compilers as proper dependencies.

   This change required a major overhaul of the concretizer, as well as a number of
   performance optimizations. See #38447, #39621.

4. **Cherry-picking virtual dependencies**

   You can now select only a subset of virtual dependencies from a spec that may provide
   more. For example, if you want `mpich` to be your `mpi` provider, you can be explicit
   by writing:

   ```
   hdf5 ^[virtuals=mpi] mpich
   ```

   Or, if you want to use, e.g., `intel-parallel-studio` for `blas` along with an external
   `lapack` like `openblas`, you could write:

   ```
   strumpack ^[virtuals=mpi] intel-parallel-studio+mkl ^[virtuals=lapack] openblas
   ```

   The `virtuals=mpi` is an edge attribute, and dependency edges in Spack graphs now
   track which virtuals they satisfied. More details in #17229 and #35322.

   Note for packaging: in Spack 0.21 `spec.satisfies("^virtual")` is true if and only if
   the package specifies `depends_on("virtual")`. This is different from Spack 0.20,
   where depending on a provider implied depending on the virtual provided. See #41002
   for an example where `^mkl` was being used to test for several `mkl` providers in a
   package that did not depend on `mkl`.

5. **License directive**

   Spack packages can now have license metadata, with the new `license()` directive:

   ```python
       license("Apache-2.0")
   ```

   Licenses use [SPDX identifiers](https://spdx.org/licenses), and you can use SPDX
   expressions to combine them:

   ```python
       license("Apache-2.0 OR MIT")
   ```

   Like other directives in Spack, it's conditional, so you can handle complex cases like
   Spack itself:

   ```python
      license("LGPL-2.1", when="@:0.11")
      license("Apache-2.0 OR MIT", when="@0.12:")
   ```

   More details in #39346, #40598.

6. **`spack deconcretize` command**

   We are getting close to having a `spack update` command for environments, but we're
   not quite there yet. This is the next best thing. `spack deconcretize` gives you
   control over what you want to update in an already concrete environment. If you have
   an environment built with, say, `meson`, and you want to update your `meson` version,
   you can run:

   ```console
   spack deconcretize meson
   ```

   and have everything that depends on `meson` rebuilt the next time you run `spack
   concretize`. In a future Spack version, we'll handle all of this in a single command,
   but for now you can use this to drop bits of your lockfile and resolve your
   dependencies again. More in #38803.

7. **UI Improvements**

   The venerable `spack info` command was looking shabby compared to the rest of Spack's
   UI, so we reworked it to have a bit more flair. `spack info` now makes much better
   use of terminal space and shows variants, their values, and their descriptions much
   more clearly. Conditional variants are grouped separately so you can more easily
   understand how packages are structured. More in #40998.

   `spack checksum` now allows you to filter versions from your editor, or by version
   range. It also notifies you about potential download URL changes. See #40403.

8. **Environments can include definitions**

   Spack did not previously support using `include:` with The
   [definitions](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments.html#spec-list-references)
   section of an environment, but now it does. You can use this to curate lists of specs
   and more easily reuse them across environments. See #33960.

9. **Aliases**

   You can now add aliases to Spack commands in `config.yaml`, e.g. this might enshrine
   your favorite args to `spack find` as `spack f`:

   ```yaml
   config:
     aliases:
       f: find -lv
   ```

   See #17229.

10. **Improved autoloading of modules**

    Spack 0.20 was the first release to enable autoloading of direct dependencies in
    module files.

    The downside of this was that `module avail` and `module load` tab completion would
    show users too many modules to choose from, and many users disabled generating
    modules for dependencies through `exclude_implicits: true`. Further, it was
    necessary to keep hashes in module names to avoid file name clashes.

    In this release, you can start using `hide_implicits: true` instead, which exposes
    only explicitly installed packages to the user, while still autoloading
    dependencies. On top of that, you can safely use `hash_length: 0`, as this config
    now only applies to the modules exposed to the user -- you don't have to worry about
    file name clashes for hidden dependencies.

   Note: for `tcl` this feature requires Modules 4.7 or higher

11. **Updated container labeling**

    Nightly Docker images from the `develop` branch will now be tagged as `:develop` and
    `:nightly`. The `:latest` tag is no longer associated with `:develop`, but with the
    latest stable release. Releases will be tagged with `:{major}`, `:{major}.{minor}`
    and `:{major}.{minor}.{patch}`. `ubuntu:18.04` has also been removed from the list of
    generated Docker images, as it is no longer supported. See #40593.

# v0.20.0 (2023-05-21)

`v0.20.0` is a major feature release.

## Features in this release

1. **`requires()` directive and enhanced package requirements**

   We've added some more enhancements to requirements in Spack (#36286).

   There is a new `requires()` directive for packages. `requires()` is the opposite of
   `conflicts()`. You can use it to impose constraints on this package when certain
   conditions are met:

   ```python
   requires(
       "%apple-clang",
       when="platform=darwin",
       msg="This package builds only with clang on macOS"
   )
   ```

   More on this in [the docs](
     https://spack.rtfd.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html#conflicts-and-requirements).

   You can also now add a `when:` clause to `requires:` in your `packages.yaml`
   configuration or in an environment:

   ```yaml
   packages:
     openmpi:
       require:
       - any_of: ["%gcc"]
         when: "@:4.1.4"
         message: "Only OpenMPI 4.1.5 and up can build with fancy compilers"
   ```

   More details can be found [here](
     https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_settings.html#package-requirements)

2. **Exact versions**

   Spack did not previously have a way to distinguish a version if it was a prefix of
   some other version. For example, `@3.2` would match `3.2`, `3.2.1`, `3.2.2`, etc. You
   can now match *exactly* `3.2` with `@=3.2`. This is useful, for example, if you need
   to patch *only* the `3.2` version of a package. The new syntax is described in [the docs](
     https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html#version-specifier).

   Generally, when writing packages, you should prefer to use ranges like `@3.2` over
   the specific versions, as this allows the concretizer more leeway when selecting
   versions of dependencies. More details and recommendations are in the [packaging guide](
     https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html#ranges-versus-specific-versions).

   See #36273 for full details on the version refactor.

3. **New testing interface**

   Writing package tests is now much simpler with a new [test interface](
     https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html#stand-alone-tests).

   Writing a test is now as easy as adding a method that starts with `test_`:

   ```python
   class MyPackage(Package):
       ...

       def test_always_fails(self):
           """use assert to always fail"""
           assert False

       def test_example(self):
           """run installed example"""
           example = which(self.prefix.bin.example)
           example()
    ```

    You can use Python's native `assert` statement to implement your checks -- no more
    need to fiddle with `run_test` or other test framework methods. Spack will
    introspect the class and run `test_*` methods when you run `spack test`,

4. **More stable concretization**

   * Now, `spack concretize` will *only* concretize the new portions of the environment
     and will not change existing parts of an environment unless you specify `--force`.
     This has always been true for `unify:false`, but not for `unify:true` and
     `unify:when_possible` environments. Now it is true for all of them (#37438, #37681).

   * The concretizer has a new `--reuse-deps` argument that *only* reuses dependencies.
     That is, it will always treat the *roots* of your environment as it would with
     `--fresh`. This allows you to upgrade just the roots of your environment while
     keeping everything else stable (#30990).

5. **Weekly develop snapshot releases**

   Since last year, we have maintained a buildcache of `develop` at
   https://binaries.spack.io/develop, but the cache can grow to contain so many builds
   as to be unwieldy. When we get a stable `develop` build, we snapshot the release and
   add a corresponding tag the Spack repository. So, you can use a stack from a specific
   day. There are now tags in the spack repository like:

   * `develop-2023-05-14`
   * `develop-2023-05-18`

   that correspond to build caches like:

   * https://binaries.spack.io/develop-2023-05-14/e4s
   * https://binaries.spack.io/develop-2023-05-18/e4s

   We plan to store these snapshot releases weekly.

6. **Specs in buildcaches can be referenced by hash.**

   * Previously, you could run `spack buildcache list` and see the hashes in
     buildcaches, but referring to them by hash would fail.
   * You can now run commands like `spack spec` and `spack install` and refer to
     buildcache hashes directly, e.g. `spack install /abc123` (#35042)

7. **New package and buildcache index websites**

   Our public websites for searching packages have been completely revamped and updated.
   You can check them out here:

   * *Package Index*: https://packages.spack.io
   * *Buildcache Index*: https://cache.spack.io

   Both are searchable and more interactive than before. Currently major releases are
   shown; UI for browsing `develop` snapshots is coming soon.

8. **Default CMake and Meson build types are now Release**

   Spack has historically defaulted to building with optimization and debugging, but
   packages like `llvm` can be enormous with debug turned on. Our default build type for
   all Spack packages is now `Release` (#36679, #37436). This has a number of benefits:

   * much smaller binaries;
   * higher default optimization level; and
   * defining `NDEBUG` disables assertions, which may lead to further speedups.

   You can still get the old behavior back through requirements and package preferences.

## Other new commands and directives

* `spack checksum` can automatically add new versions to package (#24532)
* new command: `spack pkg grep` to easily search package files (#34388)
* New `maintainers` directive (#35083)
* Add `spack buildcache push` (alias to `buildcache create`) (#34861)
* Allow using `-j` to control the parallelism of concretization (#37608)
* Add `--exclude` option to 'spack external find' (#35013)

## Other new features of note

* editing: add higher-precedence `SPACK_EDITOR` environment variable
* Many YAML formatting improvements from updating `ruamel.yaml` to the latest version
  supporting Python 3.6. (#31091, #24885, #37008).
* Requirements and preferences should not define (non-git) versions (#37687, #37747)
* Environments now store spack version/commit in `spack.lock` (#32801)
* User can specify the name of the `packages` subdirectory in repositories (#36643)
* Add container images supporting RHEL alternatives (#36713)
* make version(...) kwargs explicit (#36998)

## Notable refactors

* Bootstrap most of Spack dependencies using environments (#34029)
* Split `satisfies(..., strict=True/False)` into two functions (#35681)
* spack install: simplify behavior when inside environments (#35206)

## Binary cache and stack updates

* Major simplification of CI boilerplate in stacks (#34272, #36045)
* Many improvements to our CI pipeline's reliability

## Removals, Deprecations, and disablements
* Module file generation is disabled by default; you'll need to enable it to use it (#37258)
* Support for Python 2 was deprecated in `v0.19.0` and has been removed. `v0.20.0` only
  supports Python 3.6 and higher.
* Deprecated target names are no longer recognized by Spack. Use generic names instead:
  * `graviton` is now `cortex_a72`
  * `graviton2` is now `neoverse_n1`
  * `graviton3` is now `neoverse_v1`
* `blacklist` and `whitelist` in module configuration were deprecated in `v0.19.0` and are
  removed in this release. Use `exclude` and `include` instead.
* The `ignore=` parameter of the `extends()` directive has been removed. It was not used by
  any builtin packages and is no longer needed to avoid conflicts in environment views (#35588).
* Support for the old YAML buildcache format has been removed. It was deprecated in `v0.19.0` (#34347).
* `spack find --bootstrap` has been removed. It was deprecated in `v0.19.0`. Use `spack
  --bootstrap find` instead (#33964).
* `spack bootstrap trust` and `spack bootstrap untrust` are now removed, having been
  deprecated in `v0.19.0`. Use `spack bootstrap enable` and `spack bootstrap disable`.
* The `--mirror-name`, `--mirror-url`, and `--directory` options to buildcache and
  mirror commands were deprecated in `v0.19.0` and have now been removed. They have been
  replaced by positional arguments (#37457).
* Deprecate `env:` as top level environment key (#37424)
* deprecate buildcache create --rel, buildcache install --allow-root (#37285)
* Support for very old perl-like spec format strings (e.g., `$_$@$%@+$+$=`) has been
  removed (#37425). This was deprecated in in `v0.15` (#10556).

# v0.19.0 (2022-11-11)

`v0.19.0` is a major feature release.

## Major features in this release

1. **Package requirements**

   Spack's traditional [package preferences](
     https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_settings.html#package-preferences)
   are soft, but we've added hard requirements to `packages.yaml` and `spack.yaml`
   (#32528, #32369). Package requirements use the same syntax as specs:

   ```yaml
   packages:
     libfabric:
       require: "@1.13.2"
     mpich:
       require:
       - one_of: ["+cuda", "+rocm"]
   ```

   More details in [the docs](
     https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_settings.html#package-requirements).

2. **Environment UI Improvements**

   * Fewer surprising modifications to `spack.yaml` (#33711):

     * `spack install` in an environment will no longer add to the `specs:` list; you'll
       need to either use `spack add <spec>` or `spack install --add <spec>`.

     * Similarly, `spack uninstall` will not remove from your environment's `specs:`
       list; you'll need to use `spack remove` or `spack uninstall --remove`.

     This will make it easier to manage an environment, as there is clear separation
     between the stack to be installed (`spack.yaml`/`spack.lock`) and which parts of
     it should be installed (`spack install` / `spack uninstall`).

   * `concretizer:unify:true` is now the default mode for new environments (#31787)

     We see more users creating `unify:true` environments now. Users who need
     `unify:false` can add it to their environment to get the old behavior. This will
     concretize every spec in the environment independently.

   * Include environment configuration from URLs (#29026, [docs](
       https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments.html#included-configurations))

     You can now include configuration in your environment directly from a URL:

     ```yaml
     spack:
       include:
       - https://github.com/path/to/raw/config/compilers.yaml
     ```

4. **Multiple Build Systems**

   An increasing number of packages in the ecosystem need the ability to support
   multiple build systems (#30738, [docs](
     https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html#multiple-build-systems)),
   either across versions, across platforms, or within the same version of the software.
   This has been hard to support through multiple inheritance, as methods from different
   build system superclasses would conflict. `package.py` files can now define separate
   builder classes with installation logic for different build systems, e.g.:

   ```python
   class ArpackNg(CMakePackage, AutotoolsPackage):

       build_system(
           conditional("cmake", when="@0.64:"),
           conditional("autotools", when="@:0.63"),
           default="cmake",
       )

   class CMakeBuilder(spack.build_systems.cmake.CMakeBuilder):
       def cmake_args(self):
           pass

   class Autotoolsbuilder(spack.build_systems.autotools.AutotoolsBuilder):
       def configure_args(self):
           pass
   ```

5. **Compiler and variant propagation**

   Currently, compiler flags and variants are inconsistent: compiler flags set for a
   package are inherited by its dependencies, while variants are not. We should have
   these be consistent by allowing for inheritance to be enabled or disabled for both
   variants and compiler flags.

   Example syntax:
   - `package ++variant`:
         enabled variant that will be propagated to dependencies
   - `package +variant`:
         enabled variant that will NOT be propagated to dependencies
   - `package ~~variant`:
         disabled variant that will be propagated to dependencies
   - `package ~variant`:
         disabled variant that will NOT be propagated to dependencies
   - `package cflags==-g`:
         `cflags` will be propagated to dependencies
   - `package cflags=-g`:
         `cflags` will NOT be propagated to dependencies

   Syntax for non-boolean variants is similar to compiler flags. More in the docs for
   [variants](
     https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html#variants) and [compiler flags](
     https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html#compiler-flags).

6. **Enhancements to git version specifiers**

   * `v0.18.0` added the ability to use git commits as versions. You can now use the
     `git.` prefix to specify git tags or branches as versions. All of these are valid git
     versions in `v0.19` (#31200):

     ```console
     foo@abcdef1234abcdef1234abcdef1234abcdef1234      # raw commit
     foo@git.abcdef1234abcdef1234abcdef1234abcdef1234  # commit with git prefix
     foo@git.develop                                   # the develop branch
     foo@git.0.19                                      # use the 0.19 tag
     ```

   * `v0.19` also gives you more control over how Spack interprets git versions, in case
     Spack cannot detect the version from the git repository. You can suffix a git
     version with `=<version>` to force Spack to concretize it as a particular version
     (#30998, #31914, #32257):

     ```console
     # use mybranch, but treat it as version 3.2 for version comparison
     foo@git.mybranch=3.2

     # use the given commit, but treat it as develop for version comparison
     foo@git.abcdef1234abcdef1234abcdef1234abcdef1234=develop
     ```

     More in [the docs](
       https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html#version-specifier)

7. **Changes to Cray EX Support**

   Cray machines have historically had their own "platform" within Spack, because we
   needed to go through the module system to leverage compilers and MPI installations on
   these machines. The Cray EX programming environment now provides standalone `craycc`
   executables and proper `mpicc` wrappers, so Spack can treat EX machines like Linux
   with extra packages (#29392).

   We expect this to greatly reduce bugs, as external packages and compilers can now be
   used by prefix instead of through modules. We will also no longer be subject to
   reproducibility issues when modules change from Cray PE release to release and from
   site to site. This also simplifies dealing with the underlying Linux OS on cray
   systems, as Spack will properly model the machine's OS as either SuSE or RHEL.

8. **Improvements to tests and testing in CI**

   * `spack ci generate --tests` will generate a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file that not only does
     builds but also runs tests for built packages (#27877). Public GitHub pipelines now
     also run tests in CI.

   * `spack test run --explicit` will only run tests for packages that are explicitly
     installed, instead of all packages.

9. **Experimental binding link model**

   You can add a new option to `config.yaml` to make Spack embed absolute paths to
   needed shared libraries in ELF executables and shared libraries on Linux (#31948, [docs](
     https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_yaml.html#shared-linking-bind)):

   ```yaml
   config:
     shared_linking:
       type: rpath
       bind: true
   ```

   This can improve launch time at scale for parallel applications, and it can make
   installations less susceptible to environment variables like `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, even
   especially when dealing with external libraries that use `RUNPATH`. You can think of
   this as a faster, even higher-precedence version of `RPATH`.

## Other new features of note

* `spack spec` prints dependencies more legibly. Dependencies in the output now appear
  at the *earliest* level of indentation possible (#33406)
* You can override `package.py` attributes like `url`, directly in `packages.yaml`
  (#33275, [docs](
    https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_settings.html#assigning-package-attributes))
* There are a number of new architecture-related format strings you can use in Spack
  configuration files to specify paths (#29810, [docs](
    https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#config-file-variables))
* Spack now supports bootstrapping Clingo on Windows (#33400)
* There is now support for an `RPATH`-like library model on Windows (#31930)

## Performance Improvements

* Major performance improvements for installation from binary caches (#27610, #33628,
  #33636, #33608, #33590, #33496)
* Test suite can now be parallelized using `xdist` (used in GitHub Actions) (#32361)
* Reduce lock contention for parallel builds in environments (#31643)

## New binary caches and stacks

* We now build nearly all of E4S with `oneapi` in our buildcache (#31781, #31804,
  #31804, #31803, #31840, #31991, #32117, #32107, #32239)
* Added 3 new machine learning-centric stacks to binary cache: `x86_64_v3`, CUDA, ROCm
  (#31592, #33463)

## Removals and Deprecations

* Support for Python 3.5 is dropped (#31908). Only Python 2.7 and 3.6+ are officially
  supported.

* This is the last Spack release that will support Python 2 (#32615). Spack `v0.19`
  will emit a deprecation warning if you run it with Python 2, and Python 2 support will
  soon be removed from the `develop` branch.

* `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is no longer set by default by `spack load` or module loads.

  Setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in Spack environments/modules can cause binaries from
  outside of Spack to crash, and Spack's own builds use `RPATH` and do not need
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` set in order to run. If you still want the old behavior, you
  can run these commands to configure Spack to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:

  ```console
  spack config add modules:prefix_inspections:lib64:[LD_LIBRARY_PATH]
  spack config add modules:prefix_inspections:lib:[LD_LIBRARY_PATH]
  ```

* The `spack:concretization:[together|separately]` has been removed after being
  deprecated in `v0.18`. Use `concretizer:unify:[true|false]`.
* `config:module_roots` is no longer supported after being deprecated in `v0.18`. Use
  configuration in module sets instead (#28659, [docs](
    https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module_file_support.html)).
* `spack activate` and `spack deactivate` are no longer supported, having been
  deprecated in `v0.18`. Use an environment with a view instead of
  activating/deactivating ([docs](
    https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments.html#configuration-in-spack-yaml)).
* The old YAML format for buildcaches is now deprecated (#33707). If you are using an
  old buildcache with YAML metadata you will need to regenerate it with JSON metadata.
* `spack bootstrap trust` and `spack bootstrap untrust` are deprecated in favor of
  `spack bootstrap enable` and `spack bootstrap disable` and will be removed in `v0.20`.
  (#33600)
* The `graviton2` architecture has been renamed to `neoverse_n1`, and `graviton3`
  is now `neoverse_v1`. Buildcaches using the old architecture names will need to be rebuilt.
* The terms `blacklist` and `whitelist` have been replaced with `include` and `exclude`
  in all configuration files (#31569). You can use `spack config update` to
  automatically fix your configuration files.

## Notable Bugfixes

# v0.18.0 (2022-05-28)

`v0.18.0` is a major feature release.

## Major features in this release

1. **Concretizer now reuses by default**

   `spack install --reuse` was introduced in `v0.17.0`, and `--reuse`
   is now the default concretization mode. Spack will try hard to
   resolve dependencies using installed packages or binaries (#30396).

   To avoid reuse and to use the latest package configurations, (the
   old default), you can use `spack install --fresh`, or add
   configuration like this to your environment or `concretizer.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   concretizer:
       reuse: false
   ```

2. **Finer-grained hashes**

   Spack hashes now include `link`, `run`, *and* `build` dependencies,
   as well as a canonical hash of package recipes. Previously, hashes
   only included `link` and `run` dependencies (though `build`
   dependencies were stored by environments). We coarsened the hash to
   reduce churn in user installations, but the new default concretizer
   behavior mitigates this concern and gets us reuse *and* provenance.
   You will be able to see the build dependencies of new installations
   with `spack find`. Old installations will not change and their
   hashes will not be affected. (#28156, #28504, #30717, #30861)

3. **Improved error messages**

   Error handling with the new concretizer is now done with
   optimization criteria rather than with unsatisfiable cores, and
   Spack reports many more details about conflicting constraints.
   (#30669)

4. **Unify environments when possible**

   Environments have thus far supported `concretization: together` or
   `concretization: separately`. These have been replaced by a new
   preference in `concretizer.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   concretizer:
       unify: [true|false|when_possible]
   ```

   `concretizer:unify:when_possible` will *try* to resolve a fully
   unified environment, but if it cannot, it will create multiple
   configurations of some packages where it has to. For large
   environments that previously had to be concretized separately, this
   can result in a huge speedup (40-50x). (#28941)

5. **Automatically find externals on Cray machines**

   Spack can now automatically discover installed packages in the Cray
   Programming Environment by running `spack external find` (or `spack
   external read-cray-manifest` to *only* query the PE). Packages from
   the PE (e.g., `cray-mpich` are added to the database with full
   dependency information, and compilers from the PE are added to
   `compilers.yaml`. Available with the June 2022 release of the Cray
   Programming Environment. (#24894, #30428)

6. **New binary format and hardened signing**

   Spack now has an updated binary format, with improvements for
   security. The new format has a detached signature file, and Spack
   verifies the signature before untarring or decompressing the binary
   package. The previous format embedded the signature in a `tar`
   file, which required the client to run `tar` *before* verifying
   (#30750). Spack can still install from build caches using the old
   format, but we encourage users to switch to the new format going
   forward.

   Production GitLab pipelines have been hardened to securely sign
   binaries. There is now a separate signing stage so that signing
   keys are never exposed to build system code, and signing keys are
   ephemeral and only live as long as the signing pipeline stage.
   (#30753)

7. **Bootstrap mirror generation**

   The `spack bootstrap mirror` command can automatically create a
   mirror for bootstrapping the concretizer and other needed
   dependencies in an air-gapped environment. (#28556)

8. **Nascent Windows support**

   Spack now has initial support for Windows. Spack core has been
   refactored to run in the Windows environment, and a small number of
   packages can now build for Windows. More details are
   [in the documentation](https://spack.rtfd.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#spack-on-windows)
   (#27021, #28385, many more)

9. **Makefile generation**

   `spack env depfile` can be used to generate a `Makefile` from an
   environment, which can be used to build packages the environment
   in parallel on a single node. e.g.:

   ```console
   spack -e myenv env depfile > Makefile
   make
   ```

   Spack propagates `gmake` jobserver information to builds so that
   their jobs can share cores. (#30039, #30254, #30302, #30526)

10. **New variant features**

    In addition to being conditional themselves, variants can now have
    [conditional *values*](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html#conditional-possible-values)
    that are only possible for certain configurations of a package. (#29530)

    Variants can be
    [declared "sticky"](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html#sticky-variants),
    which prevents them from being enabled or disabled by the
    concretizer. Sticky variants must be set explicitly by users
    on the command line or in `packages.yaml`. (#28630)

* Allow conditional possible values in variants
* Add a "sticky" property to variants


## Other new features of note

* Environment views can optionally link only `run` dependencies
  with `link:run` (#29336)
* `spack external find --all` finds library-only packages in
  addition to build dependencies (#28005)
* Customizable `config:license_dir` option (#30135)
* `spack external find --path PATH` takes a custom search path (#30479)
* `spack spec` has a new `--format` argument like `spack find` (#27908)
* `spack concretize --quiet` skips printing concretized specs (#30272)
* `spack info` now has cleaner output and displays test info (#22097)
* Package-level submodule option for git commit versions (#30085, #30037)
* Using `/hash` syntax to refer to concrete specs in an environment
  now works even if `/hash` is not installed. (#30276)

## Major internal refactors

* full hash (see above)
* new develop versioning scheme `0.19.0-dev0`
* Allow for multiple dependencies/dependents from the same package (#28673)
* Splice differing virtual packages (#27919)

## Performance Improvements

* Concretization of large environments with `unify: when_possible` is
  much faster than concretizing separately (#28941, see above)
* Single-pass view generation algorithm is 2.6x faster (#29443)

## Archspec improvements

* `oneapi` and `dpcpp` flag support (#30783)
* better support for `M1` and `a64fx` (#30683)

## Removals and Deprecations

* Removed deprecated `--run-tests` option of `spack install`;
  use `spack test` (#30461)

* `spack activate` and `spack deactivate` are deprecated in favor of
  environments; will be removed in `0.19.0` (#29430; see also `link:run`
  in #29336 above)

## Notable Bugfixes

* Fix bug that broke locks with many parallel builds (#27846)
* Many bugfixes and consistency improvements for the new concretizer
  and `--reuse` (#30357, #30092, #29835, #29933, #28605, #29694, #28848)

## Packages

* `CMakePackage` uses `CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH` (#29703)
* Refactored `lua` support: `lua-lang` virtual supports both
  `lua` and `luajit` via new `LuaPackage` build system(#28854)

# v0.17.0 (2021-11-05)

`v0.17.0` is a major feature release.

## Major features in this release

1. **New concretizer is now default**
   The new concretizer introduced as an experimental feature in `v0.16.0`
   is now the default (#25502). The new concretizer is based on the
   [clingo](https://github.com/potassco/clingo) logic programming system,
   and it enables us to do much higher quality and faster dependency solving
   The old concretizer is still available via the `concretizer: original`
   setting, but it is deprecated and will be removed in `v0.18.0`.

2. **Binary Bootstrapping**
   To make it easier to use the new concretizer and binary packages,
   Spack now bootstraps `clingo` and `GnuPG` from public binaries. If it
   is not able to bootstrap them from binaries, it installs them from
   source code. With these changes, you should still be able to clone Spack
   and start using it almost immediately. (#21446, #22354, #22489, #22606,
   #22720, #22720, #23677, #23946, #24003, #25138, #25607, #25964, #26029,
   #26399, #26599).

3. **Reuse existing packages (experimental)**
   The most wanted feature from our
   [2020 user survey](https://spack.io/spack-user-survey-2020/) and
   the most wanted Spack feature of all time (#25310). `spack install`,
   `spack spec`, and `spack concretize` now have a `--reuse` option, which
   causes Spack to minimize the number of rebuilds it does. The `--reuse`
   option will try to find existing installations and binary packages locally
   and in registered mirrors, and will prefer to use them over building new
   versions. This will allow users to build from source *far* less than in
   prior versions of Spack. This feature will continue to be improved, with
   configuration options and better CLI expected in `v0.17.1`. It will become
   the *default* concretization mode in `v0.18.0`.

4. **Better error messages**
   We have improved the error messages generated by the new concretizer by
   using *unsatisfiable cores*. Spack will now print a summary of the types
   of constraints that were violated to make a spec unsatisfiable (#26719).

5. **Conditional variants**
   Variants can now have a `when="<spec>"` clause, allowing them to be
   conditional based on the version or other attributes of a package (#24858).

6. **Git commit versions**
   In an environment and on the command-line, you can now provide a full,
   40-character git commit as a version for any package with a top-level
   `git` URL.  e.g., `spack install hdf5@45bb27f58240a8da7ebb4efc821a1a964d7712a8`.
   Spack will compare the commit to tags in the git repository to understand
   what versions it is ahead of or behind.

7. **Override local config and cache directories**
   You can now set `SPACK_DISABLE_LOCAL_CONFIG` to disable the `~/.spack` and
   `/etc/spack` configuration scopes. `SPACK_USER_CACHE_PATH` allows you to
   move caches out of `~/.spack`, as well (#27022, #26735). This addresses
   common problems where users could not isolate CI environments from local
   configuration.

8. **Improvements to Spack Containerize**
   For added reproducibility, you can now pin the Spack version used by
   `spack containerize` (#21910). The container build will only build
   with the Spack version pinned at build recipe creation instead of the
   latest Spack version.

9. **New commands for dealing with tags**
   The `spack tags` command allows you to list tags on packages (#26136), and you
   can list tests and filter tags with `spack test list` (#26842).

## Other new features of note

* Copy and relocate environment views as stand-alone installations (#24832)

    (see [archspec#31](https://github.com/archspec/archspec-json/pull/31))
* `spack arch --generic` lets you get the best generic architecture for
    your node (#27061)
* added support for aocc (#20124), `arm` compiler on `graviton2` (#24904)
    and on `a64fx` (#24524),

## Infrastructure, buildcaches, and services

# v0.16.0 (2020-11-18)

`v0.16.0` is a major feature release.

## Major features in this release

1. **New concretizer (experimental)** Our new backtracking concretizer is
   now in Spack as an experimental feature. You will need to install
   `clingo@master+python` and set `concretizer: clingo` in `config.yaml`
   to use it. The original concretizer is not exhaustive and is not
   guaranteed to find a solution if one exists. We encourage you to use
   the new concretizer and to report any bugs you find with it. We
   anticipate making the new concretizer the default and including all
   required dependencies for it in Spack `v0.17`. For more details, see
   #19501.

2. **spack test (experimental)** Users can add `test()` methods to their
   packages to run smoke tests on installations with the new `spack test`
   command (the old `spack test` is now `spack unit-test`). `spack test`
   is environment-aware, so you can `spack install` an environment and
   `spack test run` smoke tests on all of its packages. Historical test
   logs can be perused with `spack test results`. Generic smoke tests for
   MPI implementations, C, C++, and Fortran compilers as well as specific
   smoke tests for 18 packages. This is marked experimental because the
   test API (`self.run_test()`) is likely to be change, but we encourage
   users to upstream tests, and we will maintain and refactor any that
   are added to mainline packages (#15702).

3. **spack develop** New `spack develop` command allows you to develop
   several packages at once within a Spack environment. Running
   `spack develop foo@v1` and `spack develop bar@v2` will check
    out specific versions of `foo` and `bar` into subdirectories, which you
    can then build incrementally with `spack install ` (#15256).

4. **More parallelism** Spack previously installed the dependencies of a
   _single_ spec in parallel. Entire environments can now be installed in
   parallel, greatly accelerating builds of large environments. get
   parallelism from individual specs. Spack now parallelizes entire
   environment builds (#18131).

5. **Customizable base images for spack containerize**
    `spack containerize` previously only output a `Dockerfile` based
    on `ubuntu`. You may now specify any base image of your choosing (#15028).

6. **more external finding** `spack external find` was added in `v0.15`,
   but only `cmake` had support. `spack external find` can now find
   `bison`, `cuda`, `findutils`, `flex`, `git`, `lustre` `m4`, `mpich`,
   `mvapich2`, `ncurses`, `openmpi`, `perl`, `spectrum-mpi`, `tar`, and
   `texinfo` on your system and add them automatically to
   `packages.yaml`.

7. **Support aocc, nvhpc, and oneapi compilers** We are aggressively
   pursuing support for the newest vendor compilers, especially those for
   the U.S. exascale and pre-exascale systems. Compiler classes and
   auto-detection for `aocc`, `nvhpc`, `oneapi` are now in Spack (#19345,
   #19294, #19330).

## Additional new features of note

* New `spack mark` command can be used to designate packages as explicitly
  installed, so that `spack gc` will not garbage-collect them (#16662).
* `install_tree` can be customized with Spack's projection format (#18341)
* `sbang` now lives in the `install_tree` so that all users can access it (#11598)
* `csh` and `tcsh` users no longer need to set `SPACK_ROOT` before
  sourcing `setup-env.csh` (#18225)
* Spec syntax now supports `variant=*` syntax for finding any package
  that has a particular variant (#19381).
* Spack respects `SPACK_GNUPGHOME` variable for custom GPG directories (#17139)
* Spack now recognizes Graviton chips

## Major refactors

* Use spawn instead of fork on Python >= 3.8 on macOS (#18205)
* Use indexes for public build caches (#19101, #19117, #19132, #19141,  #19209)
* `sbang` is an external package now (https://github.com/spack/sbang, #19582)
* `archspec` is an external package now (https://github.com/archspec/archspec, #19600)

## Deprecations and Removals

* `spack bootstrap` was deprecated in v0.14.0, and has now been removed.
* `spack setup` is deprecated as of v0.16.0.
* What was `spack test` is now called `spack unit-test`. `spack test` is
  now the smoke testing feature in (2) above.

## Bugfixes

Some of the most notable bugfixes in this release include:

* Better warning messages for deprecated syntax in `packages.yaml` (#18013)
* `buildcache list --allarch` now works properly (#17827)
* Many fixes and tests for buildcaches and binary relcoation (#15687,
  *#17455, #17418, #17455, #15687, #18110)

## Package Improvements

Spack now has 5050 total packages, 720 of which were added since `v0.15`.

* ROCm packages (`hip`, `aomp`, more) added by AMD (#19957, #19832, others)
* Many improvements for ARM support
* `llvm-flang`, `flang`, and `f18` removed, as `llvm` has real `flang`
  support since Flang was merged to LLVM mainline
* Emerging support for `spack external find` and `spack test` in packages.

## Infrastructure

* Major infrastructure improvements to pipelines on `gitlab.spack.io`
* Support for testing PRs from forks (#19248) is being enabled for all
  forks to enable rolling, up-to-date binary builds on `develop`


# v0.15.4 (2020-08-12)

This release contains one feature addition:

* Users can set `SPACK_GNUPGHOME` to override Spack's GPG path (#17139)

Several bugfixes for CUDA, binary packaging, and `spack -V`:

* CUDA package's `.libs` method searches for `libcudart` instead of `libcuda` (#18000)
* Don't set `CUDAHOSTCXX` in environments that contain CUDA (#17826)
* `buildcache create`: `NoOverwriteException` is a warning, not an error (#17832)
* Fix `spack buildcache list --allarch` (#17884)
* `spack -V` works with `releases/latest` tag and shallow clones (#17884)

And fixes for GitHub Actions and tests to ensure that CI passes on the
release branch (#15687, #17279, #17328, #17377, #17732).

# v0.15.3 (2020-07-28)

This release contains the following bugfixes:

* Fix handling of relative view paths (#17721)
* Fixes for binary relocation (#17418, #17455)
* Fix redundant printing of error messages in build environment (#17709)

It also adds a support script for Spack tutorials:

* Add a tutorial setup script to share/spack (#17705, #17722)

# v0.15.2 (2020-07-23)

This minor release includes two new features:

* Spack install verbosity is decreased, and more debug levels are added (#17546)
* The $spack/share/spack/keys directory contains public keys that may be optionally trusted for public binary mirrors (#17684)

This release also includes several important fixes:

* MPICC and related variables are now cleand in the build environment (#17450)
* LLVM flang only builds CUDA offload components when +cuda (#17466)
* CI pipelines no longer upload user environments that can contain secrets to the internet (#17545)
* CI pipelines add bootstrapped compilers to the compiler config (#17536)
* `spack buildcache list` does not exit on first failure and lists later mirrors (#17565)
* Apple's "gcc" executable that is an apple-clang compiler does not generate a gcc compiler config (#17589)
* Mixed compiler toolchains are merged more naturally across different compiler suffixes (#17590)
* Cray Shasta platforms detect the OS properly (#17467)

# v0.15.1 (2020-07-10)

This minor release includes several important fixes:

* Fix shell support on Cray (#17386)
* Fix use of externals installed with other Spack instances (#16954)
* Fix gcc+binutils build (#9024)
* Fixes for usage of intel-mpi (#17378 and #17382)
* Fixes to Autotools config.guess detection (#17333 and #17356)
* Update `spack install` message to prompt user when an environment is not
  explicitly activated (#17454)

This release also adds a mirror for all sources that are
fetched in Spack (#17077). It is expected to be useful when the
official website for a Spack package is unavailable.

# v0.15.0 (2020-06-28)

`v0.15.0` is a major feature release.

## Major Features in this release

1. **Cray support** Spack will now work properly on Cray "Cluster"
systems (non XC systems) and after a `module purge` command on Cray
systems. See #12989

2. **Virtual package configuration** Virtual packages are allowed in
packages.yaml configuration. This allows users to specify a virtual
package as non-buildable without needing to specify for each
implementation. See #14934

3. **New config subcommands** This release adds `spack config add` and
`spack config remove` commands to add to and remove from yaml
configuration files from the CLI. See #13920

4. **Environment activation** Anonymous environments are **no longer**
automatically activated in the current working directory. To activate
an environment from a `spack.yaml` file in the current directory, use
the `spack env activate .` command. This removes a concern that users
were too easily polluting their anonymous environments with accidental
installations. See #17258

5. **Apple clang compiler** The clang compiler and the apple-clang
compiler are now separate compilers in Spack. This allows Spack to
improve support for the apple-clang compiler. See #17110

6. **Finding external packages** Spack packages can now support an API
for finding external installations. This allows the `spack external
find` command to automatically add installations of those packages to
the user's configuration. See #15158


## Additional new features of note

* support for using Spack with the fish shell (#9279)
* `spack load --first` option to load first match (instead of prompting user) (#15622)
* support the Cray cce compiler both new and classic versions (#17256, #12989)
* `spack dev-build` command:
  * supports stopping before a specified phase (#14699)
  * supports automatically launching a shell in the build environment (#14887)
* `spack install --fail-fast` allows builds to fail at the first error (rather than best-effort) (#15295)
* environments: SpecList references can be dereferenced as compiler or dependency constraints (#15245)
* `spack view` command: new support for a copy/relocate view type (#16480)
* ci pipelines: see documentation for several improvements
* `spack mirror -a` command now supports excluding packages (#14154)
* `spack buildcache create` is now environment-aware (#16580)
* module generation: more flexible format for specifying naming schemes (#16629)
* lmod module generation: packages can be configured as core specs for lmod hierarchy (#16517)

## Deprecations and Removals

The following commands were deprecated in v0.13.0, and have now been removed:

* `spack configure`
* `spack build`
* `spack diy`

The following commands were deprecated in v0.14.0, and will be removed in the next major release:

* `spack bootstrap`

## Bugfixes

Some of the most notable bugfixes in this release include:

* Spack environments can now contain the string `-h` (#15429)
* The `spack install` gracefully handles being backgrounded (#15723, #14682)
* Spack uses `-isystem` instead of `-I` in cases that the underlying build system does as well (#16077)
* Spack no longer prints any specs that cannot be safely copied into a Spack command (#16462)
* Incomplete Spack environments containing python no longer cause problems (#16473)
* Several improvements to binary package relocation

## Package Improvements

The Spack project is constantly engaged in routine maintenance,
bugfixes, and improvements for the package ecosystem. Of particular
note in this release are the following:

* Spack now contains 4339 packages. There are 430 newly supported packages in v0.15.0
* GCC now builds properly on ARM architectures (#17280)
* Python: patched to support compiling mixed C/C++ python modules through distutils (#16856)
* improvements to pytorch and py-tensorflow packages
* improvements to major MPI implementations: mvapich2, mpich, openmpi, and others

## Spack Project Management:

* Much of the Spack CI infrastructure has moved from Travis to GitHub Actions (#16610, #14220, #16345)
* All merges to the `develop` branch run E4S CI pipeline (#16338)
* New `spack debug report` command makes reporting bugs easier (#15834)

# v0.14.2 (2020-04-15)

This is a minor release on the `0.14` series. It includes performance
improvements and bug fixes:

* Improvements to how `spack install` handles foreground/background (#15723)
* Major performance improvements for reading the package DB (#14693, #15777)
* No longer check for the old `index.yaml` database file (#15298)
* Properly activate environments with '-h' in the name (#15429)
* External packages have correct `.prefix` in environments/views (#15475)
* Improvements to computing env modifications from sourcing files (#15791)

# v0.14.1 (2020-03-20)

This is a bugfix release on top of `v0.14.0`.  Specific fixes include:

* several bugfixes for parallel installation (#15339, #15341, #15220, #15197)
* `spack load` now works with packages that have been renamed (#14348)
* bugfix for `suite-sparse` installation (#15326)
* deduplicate identical suffixes added to module names (#14920)
* fix issues with `configure_args` during module refresh (#11084)
* increased test coverage and test fixes (#15237, #15354, #15346)
* remove some unused code (#15431)

# v0.14.0 (2020-02-23)

`v0.14.0` is a major feature release, with 3 highlighted features:

1. **Distributed builds.** Multiple Spack instances will now coordinate
   properly with each other through locks. This works on a single node
   (where you've called `spack` several times) or across multiple nodes
   with a shared filesystem. For example, with SLURM, you could build
   `trilinos` and its dependencies on 2 24-core nodes, with 3 Spack
   instances per node and 8 build jobs per instance, with `srun -N 2 -n 6
   spack install -j 8 trilinos`. This requires a filesystem with locking
   enabled, but not MPI or any other library for parallelism.

2.  **Build pipelines.** You can also build in parallel through Gitlab
   CI. Simply create a Spack environment and push it to Gitlab to build
   on Gitlab runners. Pipeline support is now integrated into a single
   `spack ci` command, so setting it up is easier than ever.  See the
   [Pipelines section](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/v0.14.0/pipelines.html)
   in the docs.

3. **Container builds.** The new `spack containerize` command allows you
   to create a Docker or Singularity recipe from any Spack environment.
   There are options to customize the build if you need them. See the
   [Container Images section](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/containers.html)
   in the docs.

In addition, there are several other new commands, many bugfixes and
improvements, and `spack load` no longer requires modules, so you can use
it the same way on your laptop or on your supercomputer.

Spack grew by over 300 packages since our last release in November 2019,
and the project grew to over 500 contributors.  Thanks to all of you for
making yet another great release possible. Detailed notes below.

# v0.13.0 (2019-10-25)

`v0.13.0` is our biggest Spack release yet, with *many* new major features.
From facility deployment to improved environments, microarchitecture
support, and auto-generated build farms, this release has features for all of
our users.

Spack grew by over 700 packages in the past year, and the project now has
over 450 contributors.  Thanks to all of you for making this release possible.

## Major new core features
- Chaining: use dependencies from external "upstream" Spack instances
- Environments now behave more like virtualenv/conda
  - Each env has a *view*: a directory with all packages symlinked in
  - Activating an environment sets `PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `CPATH`,
    `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`, `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`, etc. to point to this view.
- Spack detects and builds specifically for your microarchitecture
  - named, understandable targets like `skylake`, `broadwell`, `power9`, `zen2`
  - Spack knows which compilers can build for which architectures
  - Packages can easily query support for features like `avx512` and `sse3`
  - You can pick a target with, e.g. `spack install foo target=icelake`
- Spack stacks: combinatorial environments for facility deployment
  - Environments can now build cartesian products of specs (with `matrix:`)
  - Conditional syntax support to exclude certain builds from the stack
- Projections: ability to build easily navigable symlink trees environments
- Support no-source packages (BundlePackage) to aggregate related packages
- Extensions: users can write custom commands that live outside of Spack repo
- Support ARM and Fujitsu compilers

## CI/build farm support
- `spack release-jobs` can detect `package.py` changes and generate
    `.gitlab-ci.yml` to create binaries for an environment or stack
	in parallel (initial support -- will change in future release).
- Results of build pipelines can be uploaded to a CDash server.
- Spack can now upload/fetch from package mirrors in Amazon S3

## New commands/options
- `spack mirror create --all` downloads *all* package sources/resources/patches
- `spack dev-build` runs phases of the install pipeline on the working directory
- `spack deprecate` permanently symlinks an old, unwanted package to a new one
- `spack verify` chcecks that packages' files match what was originally installed
- `spack find --json` prints `JSON` that is easy to parse with, e.g. `jq`
- `spack find --format FORMAT` allows you to flexibly print package metadata
- `spack spec --json` prints JSON version of `spec.yaml`

## Selected improvements
- Auto-build requested compilers if they do not exist
- Spack automatically adds `RPATHs` needed to make executables find compiler
    runtime libraries (e.g., path to newer `libstdc++` in `icpc` or `g++`)
- setup-env.sh is now compatible with Bash, Dash, and Zsh
- Spack now caps build jobs at min(16, ncores) by default
- `spack compiler find` now also throttles number of spawned processes
- Spack now writes stage directories directly to `$TMPDIR` instead of
    symlinking stages within `$spack/var/spack/cache`.
- Improved and more powerful `spec` format strings
- You can pass a `spec.yaml` file anywhere in the CLI you can type a spec.
- Many improvements to binary caching
- Gradually supporting new features from Environment Modules v4
- `spack edit` respects `VISUAL` environment variable
- Simplified package syntax for specifying build/run environment modifications
- Numerous improvements to support for environments across Spack commands
- Concretization improvements

## Documentation
- Multi-lingual documentation (Started a Japanese translation)
- Tutorial now has its own site at spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io
  - This enables us to keep multiple versions of the tutorial around

## Deprecations
- Spack no longer supports dotkit (LLNL's homegrown, now deprecated module tool)
- `spack build`, `spack configure`, `spack diy` deprecated in favor of
    `spack dev-build` and `spack install`

## Important package changes
- 3,563 total packages (718 added since 0.12.1)
- Spack now defaults to Python 3 (previously preferred 2.7 by default)
- Much improved ARM support thanks to Fugaku (RIKEN) and SNL teams
