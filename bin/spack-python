# spack-python
#
# If you want to write your own executable Python script that uses Spack
# modules, on Mac OS or maybe some others, you may be able to do it like
# this:
#
#   #!/usr/bin/env spack python
#
# Mac OS supports the above syntax, but it's not standard and most Linuxes
# don't support more than one argument after the shebang command.  This
# script is a workaround. Do this in your Python script instead:
#
#   #!/usr/bin/env spack-python
#
# This is compatible across platforms.
#
/usr/bin/env spack python "$@"
