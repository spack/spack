# This is the default spack configuration file.
#
# Settings here are versioned with Spack and are intended to provide
# sensible defaults out of the box. Spack maintainers should edit this
# file to keep it current.
#
# Users can override these settings by editing the following files.
#
# Per-spack-instance settings (overrides defaults):
#   $SPACK_ROOT/etc/spack/config.yaml
#
# Per-user settings (overrides default and site settings):
#   ~/.spack/config.yaml

config:
  # This is the path to the root of the Spack install tree.
  # You can use $spack here to refer to the root of the spack instance.
  install_tree: $spack/opt/spack


  # Locations where templates should be found
  template_dirs:
    - $spack/share/spack/templates


  # Default directory layout

  # Temporary locations Spack can try to use for builds.
  #
  # Recommended options are given below.
  #
  # Builds can be faster in temporary directories on some (e.g., HPC) systems.
  # Specifying `$tempdir` will ensure use of the default temporary directory
  # (i.e., ``$TMP` or ``$TMPDIR``).
  #
  # Another option that prevents conflicts and potential permission issues is
  # to specify `~/.spack/stage`, which ensures each user builds in their home
  # directory.
  #
  # A more traditional path uses the value of `$spack/var/spack/stage`, which
  # builds directly inside Spack's instance without staging them in a
  # temporary space.  Problems with specifying a path inside a Spack instance
  # are that it precludes its use as a system package and its ability to be
  # pip installable.
  #
  # In any case, if the username is not already in the path, Spack will append
  # the value of `$user` in an attempt to avoid potential conflicts between
  # users in shared temporary spaces.
  #
  # The build stage can be purged with `spack clean --stage` and
  # `spack clean -a`, so it is important that the specified directory uniquely
  # identifies Spack staging to avoid accidentally wiping out non-Spack work.
  build_stage:
  # skipping tempdir b/c running mpi tests fails with local fs
  # - $tempdir/$user/spack-stage
  # - ~/.spack/stage
  # prefer current working dir as stage
    - $spack/var/spack/stage


  # Cache directory for already downloaded source tarballs and archived
  # repositories. This can be purged with `spack clean --downloads`.
  source_cache: $spack/var/spack/cache


  # Cache directory for miscellaneous files, like the package index.
  # This can be purged with `spack clean --misc-cache`

  # If this is false, tools like curl that use SSL will not verify
  # certifiates. (e.g., curl will use use the -k option)

  # If set to true, Spack will attempt to build any compiler on the spec
  # that is not already available. If set to False, Spack will only use
  # compilers already configured in compilers.yaml
  install_missing_compilers: False


  # If set to true, Spack will always check checksums after downloading
  # archives. If false, Spack skips the checksum step.
  checksum: true


  # If set to true, `spack install` and friends will NOT clean
  # potentially harmful variables from the build environment. Use wisely.
  dirty: false


  # The language the build environment will use. This will produce English
  # compiler messages by default, so the log parser can highlight errors.
  # If set to C, it will use English (see man locale).

  # user's environment.

  # When set to true, concurrent instances of Spack will use locks to
  # avoid modifying the install tree, database file, etc. If false, Spack
  # will disable all locking, but you must NOT run concurrent instances
  # of Spack.  For filesystems that don't support locking, you should set
  # this to false and run one Spack at a time, but otherwise we recommend
  # enabling locks.
  locks: false


  # The maximum number of jobs to use when running `make` in parallel,
  # always limited by the number of cores available. For instance:
  # - If set to 16 on a 4 cores machine `spack install` will run `make -j4`
  # - If set to 16 on a 18 cores machine `spack install` will run `make -j16`
  # If not set, Spack will use all available cores up to 16.
  build_jobs: 8


  # If set to true, Spack will use ccache to cache C compiles.
  ccache: false


  # How long to wait to lock the Spack installation database. This lock is used
  # when Spack needs to manage its own package metadata and all operations are
  # expected to complete within the default time limit. The timeout should
  # therefore generally be left untouched.
  db_lock_timeout: 120


  # How long to wait when attempting to modify a package (e.g. to install it).
  # This value should typically be 'null' (never time out) unless the Spack
  # instance only ever has a single user at a time, and only if the user
  # anticipates that a significant delay indicates that the lock attempt will
  # never succeed.
  package_lock_timeout: null
