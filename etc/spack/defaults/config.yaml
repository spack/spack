# This is the default spack configuration file.
#
# Settings here are versioned with Spack and are intended to provide
# sensible defaults out of the box. Spack maintainers should edit this
# file to keep it current.
#
# Users can override these settings by editing the following files.
#
# Per-spack-instance settings (overrides defaults):
#   $SPACK_ROOT/etc/spack/config.yaml
#
# Per-user settings (overrides default and site settings):
#   ~/.spack/config.yaml
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------
config:
  # This is the path to the root of the Spack install tree.
  # You can use $spack here to refer to the root of the spack instance.
  install_tree:
    root: $spack/opt/spack
    projections:
      all: "${ARCHITECTURE}/${COMPILERNAME}-${COMPILERVER}/${PACKAGE}-${VERSION}-${HASH}"
    # install_tree can include an optional padded length (int or boolean)
    # default is False (do not pad)
    # if padded_length is True, Spack will pad as close to the system max path
    # length as possible
    # if padded_length is an integer, Spack will pad to that many characters,
    # assuming it is higher than the length of the install_tree root.
    # padded_length: 128


  # Locations where templates should be found
  template_dirs:
    - $spack/share/spack/templates

  # `build_stage` determines where Spack builds packages.
  #
  # The default build location is `$tempdir/$user/spack-stage/$instance`.
  # `$tempdir` indicates that we should build in a temporary directory
  # (i.e., ``$TMP` or ``$TMPDIR``). On most systems (especially HPC
  # machines), building in a temporary directory is significantly faster
  # than other locations. `$user` ensures that the directory is unique by
  # user, so different users do not fight over Spack's build location.
  # Finally, `$instance` is an 8-digit hash that is unique per instance
  # of Spack. This ensures that different Spack instances do not fight
  # over build locations.
  #
  # The second choice, if Spack cannot create the first one for some
  # reason, is `~/.spack/stage/$instance`. This is unique to each user's
  # home directory, and it is also unique to each Spack instance.
  #
  # These choices both have the username in the path. If the username is
  # NOT in your chosen `build_stage` location, Spack will append it
  # anyway, to avoid conflicts among users in shared temporary spaces.
  #
  # The build stage can be purged with `spack clean`, so it is important
  # to choose a directory that is ONLY used by Spack so that you do not
  # accidentally wipe out files that have nothing to do with Spack.
  build_stage:
    - $tempdir/$user/spack-stage/$instance
    - ~/.spack/stage/$instance

  # Directory in which to run tests and store test results.
  # Tests will be stored in directories named by date/time and package

  # Cache directory for already downloaded source tarballs and archived
  # repositories. This can be purged with `spack clean --downloads`.

  # Suppress gpg warnings from binary package verification
  # Only suppresses warnings, gpg failure will still fail the install
  # Potential rationale to set True: users have already explicitly trusted the

  # is self-signed or something of the sort.
  suppress_gpg_warnings: false


  # If set to true, Spack will attempt to build any compiler on the spec
  # that is not already available. If set to False, Spack will only use

  # If set to true, Spack will always check checksums after downloading
  # archives. If false, Spack skips the checksum step.
  checksum: true


  # If set to true, Spack will fetch deprecated versions without warning.
  # If false, Spack will raise an error when trying to install a deprecated version.
  deprecated: false


  # If set to true, `spack install` and friends will NOT clean
  # potentially harmful variables from the build environment. Use wisely.
  dirty: false


  # The language the build environment will use. This will produce English
  # compiler messages by default, so the log parser can highlight errors.
  # If set to C, it will use English (see man locale).

  # user's environment.
  build_language: C


  # When set to true, concurrent instances of Spack will use locks to
  # avoid modifying the install tree, database file, etc. If false, Spack
  # will disable all locking, but you must NOT run concurrent instances
  # of Spack.  For filesystems that don't support locking, you should set
  # this to false and run one Spack at a time, but otherwise we recommend
  # enabling locks.
  locks: true


  # The maximum number of jobs to use when running `make` in parallel,
  # always limited by the number of cores available. For instance:
  # - If set to 16 on a 4 cores machine `spack install` will run `make -j4`
  # - If set to 16 on a 18 cores machine `spack install` will run `make -j16`
  # If not set, Spack will use all available cores up to 16.
  # build_jobs: 16


  # If set to true, Spack will use ccache to cache C compiles.

  # The concretization algorithm to use in Spack. Options are:
  #
  #   'original': Spack's original greedy, fixed-point concretizer. This
  #       algorithm can make decisions too early and will not backtrack
  #       sufficiently for many specs.
  #
  #   'clingo': Uses a logic solver under the hood to solve DAGs with full
  #       backtracking and optimization for user preferences.
  #
  # 'clingo' currently requires the clingo ASP solver to be installed and
  # built with python bindings. 'original' is built in.

  # How long to wait to lock the Spack installation database. This lock is used
  # when Spack needs to manage its own package metadata and all operations are
  # expected to complete within the default time limit. The timeout should
  # therefore generally be left untouched.
  db_lock_timeout: 3


  # How long to wait when attempting to modify a package (e.g. to install it).
  # This value should typically be 'null' (never time out) unless the Spack
  # instance only ever has a single user at a time, and only if the user
  # anticipates that a significant delay indicates that the lock attempt will
  # never succeed.
  package_lock_timeout: null


  # Control whether Spack embeds RPATH or RUNPATH attributes in ELF binaries.
  # Has no effect on macOS. DO NOT MIX these within the same install tree.
