# Settings here are versioned with Spack and are intended to provide
# sensible defaults out of the box. Spack maintainers should edit this
# file to keep it current.
#
# Users can override these settings by editing the following files.
#
# Per-spack-instance settings (overrides defaults):
#   $SPACK_ROOT/etc/spack/config.yaml
#
# Per-user settings (overrides default and site settings):
#   ~/.spack/config.yaml

  # Spack will use the first one it finds that exists and is writable.
  # You can use $tempdir to refer to the system default temp directory
  # (as returned by tempfile.gettempdir()).
  #
  # A value of $spack/var/spack/stage indicates that Spack should run
  # builds directly inside its install directory without staging them in
  # temporary space.
  #
  # The build stage can be purged with `spack clean --stage`.

  # If set to true, Spack will always check checksums after downloading
  # archives. If false, Spack skips the checksum step.

  # potentially harmful variables from the build environment. Use wisely.

  # The language the build environment will use. This will produce English
  # compiler messages by default, so the log parser can highlight errors.

  # user's environment.

  # When set to true, concurrent instances of Spack will use locks to
  # avoid modifying the install tree, database file, etc. If false, Spack
  # will disable all locking, but you must NOT run concurrent instances
  # of Spack.  For filesystems that don't support locking, you should set
  # this to false and run one Spack at a time, but otherwise we recommend
  # enabling locks.
  locks: true

  # If set to 4, for example, `spack install` will run `make -j4`.

  # If set to true, spack will use ccache to cache c compiles.

  # How long to wait to lock the Spack installation database. This lock is used
  # when spack needs to manage its own package metadata and all operations are
  # expected to complete within the default time limit. The timeout should
  # therefore generally be left untouched.

  # never succeed.
