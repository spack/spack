=============
Build Systems
=============

Spack defines a number of classes which understand how to use common
`build systems  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_build_automation_software>`_
(Makefiles, CMake, etc.). Spack package definitions can inherit these
classes in order to streamline their builds.

This guide provides information specific to each particular build system.
It assumes that you've read the :ref:`packaging-guide` and expands
on these ideas for each distinct build system that Spack supports:

For reference, the :py:mod:`Build System API docs <spack.build_systems>`
provide a list of build systems and methods/attributes that can be
overridden. If you are curious about the implementation of a particular
build system, you can view the source code by running:

.. code-block:: console

   $ spack edit --build-system autotools


This will open up the ``AutotoolsPackage`` definition in your favorite
editor. In addition, if you are working with a less common build system
like QMake, SCons, or Waf, it may be useful to see examples of other
packages. You can quickly find examples by running:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd var/spack/repos/builtin/packages
   $ grep -l QMakePackage */package.py


You can then view these packages with ``spack edit``.

This guide is intended to supplement the
:py:mod:`Build System API docs <spack.build_systems>` with examples of
how to override commonly used methods. It also provides rules of thumb
and suggestions for package developers who are unfamiliar with a
particular build system.
