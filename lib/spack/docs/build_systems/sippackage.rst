SIP
---

SIP is a tool that makes it very easy to create Python bindings for C and C++
libraries. It was originally developed to create PyQt, the Python bindings for
the Qt toolkit, but can be used to create bindings for any C or C++ library.

SIP comprises a code generator and a Python module. The code generator
processes a set of specification files and generates C or C++ code which is
then compiled to create the bindings extension module. The SIP Python module
provides support functions to the automatically generated code.

^^^^^^
Phases
^^^^^^

The ``SIPBuilder`` and ``SIPPackage`` base classes come with the following phases:

#. ``configure`` - configure the package
#. ``build`` - build the package
#. ``install`` - install the package

By default, these phases run:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sip-build --verbose --target-dir ...
   $ make
   $ make install


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Important files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each SIP package comes with a custom configuration file written in Python.
For newer packages, this is called ``project.py``, while in older packages,
it may be called ``configure.py``. This script contains instructions to build
the project.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Build system dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``SIPPackage`` requires several dependencies. Python and SIP are needed at build-time
to run the aforementioned configure script. Python is also needed at run-time to
actually use the installed Python library. And as we are building Python bindings
for C/C++ libraries, Python is also needed as a link dependency. All of these
dependencies are automatically added via the base class.

.. code-block:: python

   extends("python", type=("build", "link", "run"))
   depends_on("py-sip", type="build")


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Passing arguments to ``sip-build``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each phase comes with a ``<phase_args>`` function that can be used to pass
arguments to that particular phase. For example, if you need to pass
arguments to the configure phase, you can use:

.. code-block:: python

   def configure_args(self):
       return ["--no-python-dbus"]


A list of valid options can be found by running ``sip-build --help``.

^^^^^^^
Testing
^^^^^^^

Just because a package successfully built does not mean that it built
correctly. The most reliable test of whether or not the package was
correctly installed is to attempt to import all of the modules that
get installed. To get a list of modules, run the following command
in the site-packages directory:

.. code-block:: console

   $ python
   >>> import setuptools
   >>> setuptools.find_packages()
   [
       'PyQt5', 'PyQt5.QtCore', 'PyQt5.QtGui', 'PyQt5.QtHelp',
       'PyQt5.QtMultimedia', 'PyQt5.QtMultimediaWidgets', 'PyQt5.QtNetwork',
       'PyQt5.QtOpenGL', 'PyQt5.QtPrintSupport', 'PyQt5.QtQml',
       'PyQt5.QtQuick', 'PyQt5.QtSvg', 'PyQt5.QtTest', 'PyQt5.QtWebChannel',
       'PyQt5.QtWebSockets', 'PyQt5.QtWidgets', 'PyQt5.QtXml',
       'PyQt5.QtXmlPatterns'
    ]


Large, complex packages like ``py-pyqt5`` will return a long list of
packages, while other packages may return an empty list. These packages
only install a single ``foo.py`` file. In Python packaging lingo,
a "package" is a directory containing files like:

.. code-block:: none

   foo/__init__.py
   foo/bar.py
   foo/baz.py


whereas a "module" is a single Python file.

The ``SIPPackage`` base class automatically detects these module
names for you. If, for whatever reason, the module names detected
are wrong, you can provide the names yourself by overriding
``import_modules`` like so:

.. code-block:: python

   import_modules = ['PyQt5']


These tests often catch missing dependencies and non-RPATHed
libraries. Make sure not to add modules/packages containing the word
"test", as these likely won't end up in the installation directory,
or may require test dependencies like pytest to be installed.

These tests can be triggered by running ``spack install --test=root``
or by running ``spack test run`` after the installation has finished.
