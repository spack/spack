"""This module contains the following external, potentially separately
licensed, packages that are included in Spack:

altgraph
--------

* Homepage: https://altgraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
* Usage: dependency of macholib
* Version: 0.17.3

archspec
--------

* Homepage: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/archspec
* Usage: Labeling, comparison and detection of microarchitectures
* Version: 0.2.2 (commit 1dc58a5776dd77e6fc6e4ba5626af5b1fb24996e)

astunparse
----------------

* Homepage: https://github.com/simonpercivall/astunparse
* Usage: Unparsing Python ASTs for package hashes in Spack
* Version: 1.6.3 (plus modifications)
* Note: This is in ``spack.util.unparse`` because it's very heavily
  modified, and we want to track coverage for it.
  Specifically, we have modified this library to generate consistent unparsed ASTs
  regardless of the Python version. It is based on:
    1. The original ``astunparse`` library;
    2. Modifications for consistency;
    3. Backports from the ``ast.unparse`` function in Python 3.9 and later
  The unparsing is now mostly consistent with upstream ``ast.unparse``, so if
  we ever require Python 3.9 or higher, we can drop this external package.
