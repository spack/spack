class Microarchitecture:
    """Represents a specific CPU micro-architecture.

    Args:
        name (str): name of the micro-architecture (e.g. skylake).
        parents (list): list of parents micro-architectures, if any.
            Parenthood is considered by cpu features and not
            chronologically. As such each micro-architecture is
            compatible with its ancestors. For example "skylake",
            which has "broadwell" as a parent, supports running binaries
            optimized for "broadwell".
        vendor (str): vendor of the micro-architecture
        features (list of str): supported CPU flags. Note that the semantic
            of the flags in this field might vary among architectures, if
            at all present. For instance x86_64 processors will list all
            the flags supported by a given CPU while Arm processors will
            list instead only the flags that have been added on top of the
            base model for the current micro-architecture.
        compilers (dict): compiler support to generate tuned code for this
            micro-architecture. This dictionary has as keys names of
            supported compilers, while values are list of dictionaries
            with fields:

            * name: name of the micro-architecture according to the
                compiler. This is the name passed to the ``-march`` option
                or similar. Not needed if the name is the same as that
                passed in as argument above.
            * versions: versions that support this micro-architecture.

        generation (int): generation of the micro-architecture, if
            relevant.
