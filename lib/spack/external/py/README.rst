The py lib is a Python development support library featuring
the following tools and modules:

* ``py.path``:  uniform local and svn path objects
* ``py.apipkg``:  explicit API control and lazy-importing
* ``py.iniconfig``:  easy parsing of .ini files
* ``py.code``: dynamic code generation and introspection

NOTE: prior to the 1.4 release this distribution used to
contain py.test which is now its own package, see http://pytest.org
