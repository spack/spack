                compatible with its ancestors. For example "skylake",
                which has "broadwell" as a parent, supports running binaries
                optimized for "broadwell".
            vendor (str): vendor of the micro-architecture
            features (list of str): supported CPU flags. Note that the semantic
                of the flags in this field might vary among architectures, if
                at all present. For instance x86_64 processors will list all
                the flags supported by a given CPU while Arm processors will
                list instead only the flags that have been added on top of the
                base model for the current micro-architecture.

                micro-architecture. This dictionary has as keys names of
                supported compilers, while values are list of dictionaries

                    passed in as argument above.
                * versions: versions that support this micro-architecture.
