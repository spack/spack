        Intel's product names, scope, and directory layout changed over the
        years.  This function provides a unified interface to their directory
        names.

        Parameters:

            component_path (str): a component name like 'mkl', or 'mpi', or a
                deeper relative path.

            component_suite_dir (str): _Unversioned_ name of the expected
                parent directory of component_path.  When absent or `None`, an
                appropriate default will be used.  A present but empty string
                `""` requests that `component_path` refer to `self.prefix`
                directly.

                Typical values: `compilers_and_libraries`, `composer_xe`,
                `parallel_studio_xe`.

                Also supported: `advisor`, `inspector`, `vtune`. The actual
                directory name for these suites varies by release year. The
                name will be corrected as needed for use in the return value.

            relative (bool): When True, return path relative to self.prefix,
                otherwise, return an absolute path (the default).
