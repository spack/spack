# Troubleshooting advice for +rocm builds:
#
# 1. When building with clang, go your compilers.yaml,
#    add an entry for the amd version of clang, as below.
#    This will ensure that your entire package is compiled/linked
#    with the same compiler version. If you use a different version of
#    clang which is linked against a different version of the gcc library,
#    you will get errors along the lines of:
#    undefined reference to
#       `std::__throw_out_of_range_fmt(char const*, ...)@@GLIBCXX_3.4.20'
#    which is indicative of a mismatch in standard library versions.
#
#    in compilers.yaml
#    - compiler:
#        spec: clang@amd
#        paths:
#          cc: /opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang
#          cxx: /opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang++
#          f77:
#          fc:
#        flags: {}
#        operating_system: rhel7
#        target: x86_64
#        modules: []
#        environment: {}
#        extra_rpaths: []
#
#    It is advisable to replace /rocm/ in the paths above with /rocm-version/
#    and introduce spec version numbers to ensure reproducible results.
#
# 2. hip and its dependencies are currently NOT picked up by spack
#    automatically, and should therefore be added to packages.yaml by hand:
#
#    in packages.yaml:
#    hip:
#      externals:
#      - spec: hip
#        prefix: /opt/rocm/hip
#        extra_attributes:
#          compilers:
#            c: /opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang++
#            c++: /opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang++
#            hip: /opt/rocm/hip/bin/hipcc
#      buildable: false
#    hsa-rocr-dev:
#      externals:
#      - spec: hsa-rocr-dev
#        prefix: /opt/rocm
#        extra_attributes:
#          compilers:
#            c: /opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang++
#            cxx: /opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang++
#      buildable: false
#    llvm-amdgpu:
#      externals:
#      - spec: llvm-amdgpu
#        prefix: /opt/rocm/llvm
#        extra_attributes:
#          compilers:
#            c: /opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang++
#            cxx: /opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang++
#      buildable: false
#
#    It is advisable to replace /rocm/ in the paths above with /rocm-version/
#    and introduce spec version numbers to ensure reproducible results.
#
# 3. In part 2, DO NOT list the path to hsa as /opt/rocm/hsa ! You want spack
#    to find hsa in /opt/rocm/include/hsa/hsa.h . The directory of
#    /opt/rocm/hsa also has an hsa.h file, but it won't be found because spack
#    does not like its directory structure.
