        # NAG does not support a flag that would enable verbose output and
        # compilation/linking at the same time (with either '-#' or '-dryrun'
        # the compiler only prints the commands but does not run them).
        # Therefore, the only thing we can do is to pass the '-v' argument to
        # the underlying GCC. In order to get verbose output from the latter
        # at both compile and linking stages, we need to call NAG with two
        # additional flags: '-Wc,-v' and '-Wl,-v'. However, we return only
        # '-Wl,-v' for the following reasons:
        #   1) the interface of this method does not support multiple flags in
        #      the return value and, at least currently, verbose output at the
        #      linking stage has a higher priority for us;
        #   2) NAG is usually mixed with GCC compiler, which also accepts
        #      '-Wl,-v' and produces meaningful result with it: '-v' is passed
        #      to the linker and the latter produces verbose output for the
        #      linking stage ('-Wc,-v', however, would break the compilation
        #      with a message from GCC that the flag is not recognized).
        #
        # This way, we at least enable the implicit rpath detection, which is
        # based on compilation of a C file (see method
        # spack.compiler._get_compiler_link_paths): in the case of a mixed
        # NAG/GCC toolchain, the flag will be passed to g++ (e.g.
        # 'g++ -Wl,-v ./main.c'), otherwise, the flag will be passed to nagfor
        # (e.g. 'nagfor -Wl,-v ./main.c' - note that nagfor recognizes '.c'
        # extension and treats the file accordingly). The list of detected
        # rpaths will contain only GCC-related directories and rpaths to
        # NAG-related directories are injected by nagfor anyway.
