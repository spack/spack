"""Spack's installation tracking database.

The database serves two purposes:

  1. It implements a cache on top of a potentially very large Spack
     directory hierarchy, speeding up many operations that would
     otherwise require filesystem access.

  2. It will allow us to track external installations as well as lost
     packages and their dependencies.

Prior to the implementation of this store, a directory layout served
as the authoritative database of packages in Spack.  This module
provides a cache and a sanity checking mechanism for what is in the
filesystem.
