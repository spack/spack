"""This package contains directives that can be used within a package.

Directives are functions that can be called inside a package
definition to modify the package, for example:

    class OpenMpi(Package):
        depends_on("hwloc")
        provides("mpi")
        ...

``provides`` and ``depends_on`` are spack directives.

The available directives are:

  * ``conflicts``
  * ``depends_on``
  * ``extends``
  * ``patch``
  * ``provides``
  * ``resource``
  * ``variant``
  * ``version``

        Spack directives allow you to modify a package while it is being
        defined, e.g. to add version or dependency information.  Directives
        are one of the key pieces of Spack's package "language", which is
        embedded in python.

        Here's an example directive:

        .. code-block:: python

            @directive(dicts='versions')
            version(pkg, ...):
                ...

        This directive allows you write:

        .. code-block:: python

            class Foo(Package):
                version(...)

        The ``@directive`` decorator handles a couple things for you:

          1. Adds the class scope (pkg) as an initial parameter when
             called, like a class method would.  This allows you to modify
             a package from within a directive, while the package is still
             being defined.

          2. It automatically adds a dictionary called "versions" to the
             package so that you can refer to pkg.versions.

        The ``(dicts='versions')`` part ensures that ALL packages in Spack
        will have a ``versions`` attribute after they're constructed, and
        that if no directive actually modified it, it will just be an
        empty dict.

        This is just a modular way to add storage attributes to the
        Package class, and it's how Spack gets information from the
        packages to the core.
