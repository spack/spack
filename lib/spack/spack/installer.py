"""
This module encapsulates package installation functionality.

The PackageInstaller coordinates concurrent builds of packages for the same
Spack instance by leveraging the dependency DAG and file system locks.  It
also proceeds with the installation of non-dependent packages of failed
dependencies in order to install as many dependencies of a package as possible.

Bottom-up traversal of the dependency DAG while prioritizing packages with no
uninstalled dependencies allows multiple processes to perform concurrent builds
of separate packages associated with a spec.

File system locks enable coordination such that no two processes attempt to
build the same or a failed dependency package.

Failures to install dependency packages result in removal of their dependents'
build tasks from the current process.  A failure file is also written (and
locked) so that other processes can detect the failure and adjust their build
tasks accordingly.

This module supports the coordination of local and distributed concurrent
installations of packages in a Spack instance.
