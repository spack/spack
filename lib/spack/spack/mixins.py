    """Substitutes any path referring to a Spack compiler wrapper with the
    path of the underlying compiler that has been used.

    If this isn't done, the files will have CC, CXX, F77, and FC set to
    Spack's generic cc, c++, f77, and f90. We want them to be bound to
    whatever compiler they were built with.

    Args:
        *files: files to be filtered relative to the search root (which is,
            by default, the installation prefix)

        **kwargs: allowed keyword arguments

            after
                specifies after which phase the files should be
                filtered (defaults to 'install')

            relative_root
                path relative to prefix where to start searching for
                the files to be filtered. If not set the install prefix
                wil be used as the search root. **It is highly recommended
                to set this, as searching from the installation prefix may
                affect performance severely in some cases**.

                these two keyword arguments, if present, will be forwarded
                to ``filter_file`` (see its documentation for more information
                on their behavior)

            recursive
                this keyword argument, if present, will be forwarded to
