"""This module contains utilities for using multi-methods in
spack. You can think of multi-methods like overloaded methods --
they're methods with the same name, and we need to select a version
of the method based on some criteria.  e.g., for overloaded
methods, you would select a version of the method to call based on
the types of its arguments.

In spack, multi-methods are used to ease the life of package
authors.  They allow methods like install() (or other methods
called by install()) to declare multiple versions to be called when
the package is instantiated with different specs.  e.g., if the
package is built with OpenMPI on x86_64,, you might want to call a
different install method than if it was built for mpich2 on
BlueGene/Q.  Likewise, you might want to do a different type of
install for different versions of the package.

Multi-methods provide a simple decorator-based syntax for this that
avoids overly complicated rat nests of if statements.  Obviously,
depending on the scenario, regular old conditionals might be clearer,
so package authors should use their judgement.

       instantiated with a particular spec, and you may want to
       execute different versions of methods based on what the spec
       looks like.  For example, you might want to call a different
       version of install() for one platform than you call on another.

       The SpecMultiMethod class implements a callable object that
       handles method dispatch.  When it is called, it looks through
       registered methods and their associated specs, and it tries
       to find one that matches the package's spec.  If it finds one
       (and only one), it will call that method.

       This is intended for use with decorators (see below).  The
       decorator (see docs below) creates SpecMultiMethods and
       registers method versions with them.

       To register a method, you can do something like this:
           mm = SpecMultiMethod()
           mm.register("^chaos_5_x86_64_ib", some_method)

       The object registered needs to be a Spec or some string that
       will parse to be a valid spec.

       When the mm is actually called, it selects a version of the
       method to call based on the sys_type of the object it is
       called on.

       See the docs for decorators below for more details.

              class SomePackage(Package):
                  ...

                  def install(self, prefix):

           Note that this works for methods other than install, as well.  So,

           could do this:

           Note that the default version of decorated methods must
           *always* come first.  Otherwise it will override all of the
           platform-specific versions.  There's not much we can do to get
           around this because of the way decorators work.
