    """Get the current macOS version as a version object.

    This has three mechanisms for determining the macOS version, which is used
    for spack identification (the ``os`` in the spec's ``arch``) and indirectly
    for setting the value of ``MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET``, which affects the
    ``minos`` value of the ``LC_BUILD_VERSION`` macho header. Mixing ``minos``
    values can lead to lots of linker warnings, and using a consistent version
    (pinned to the major OS version) allows distribution across clients that
    might be slightly behind.

    The version determination is made with three mechanisms in decreasing
    priority:

    1. The ``MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`` variable overrides the actual operating
       system version, just like the value can be used to build for older macOS
       targets on newer systems. Spack currently will truncate this value when
       building packages, but at least the major version will be the same.

    2. The system ``sw_vers`` command reports the actual operating system
       version.

    3. The Python ``platform.mac_ver`` function is a fallback if the operating
       system identification fails, because some Python versions and/or
       installations report the OS
       on which Python was *built* rather than the one on which it is running.
