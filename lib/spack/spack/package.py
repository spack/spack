"""
This is where most of the action happens in Spack.
See the Package docs for detailed instructions on how the class works
and on how to write your own packages.

The spack package structure is based strongly on Homebrew
(http://wiki.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/), mainly because
Homebrew makes it very easy to create packages.  For a complete
rundown on spack and how it differs from homebrew, look at the

class PackageBase(with_metaclass(PackageMeta, object)):
    """This is the superclass for all spack packages.

    ***The Package class***

    Package is where the bulk of the work of installing packages is done.

    A package defines how to fetch, verfiy (via, e.g., md5), build, and
    install a piece of software.  A Package also defines what other
    packages it depends on, so that dependencies can be installed along
    with the package itself.  Packages are written in pure python.

    Packages are all submodules of spack.packages.  If spack is installed
    in ``$prefix``, all of its python files are in ``$prefix/lib/spack``.
    Most of them are in the spack module, so all the packages live in
    ``$prefix/lib/spack/spack/packages``.

    All you have to do to create a package is make a new subclass of Package
    in this directory.  Spack automatically scans the python files there
    and figures out which one to import when you invoke it.

    **An example package**

    Let's look at the cmake package to start with.  This package lives in
    ``$prefix/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/cmake/package.py``:

    .. code-block:: python

       from spack import *
       class Cmake(Package):
           homepage  = 'https://www.cmake.org'
           url       = 'http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.10.2.tar.gz'
           md5       = '097278785da7182ec0aea8769d06860c'

           def install(self, spec, prefix):
               configure('--prefix=%s'   % prefix,
                         '--parallel=%s' % make_jobs)
               make()
               make('install')

    **Naming conventions**

    There are two names you should care about:

    1. The module name, ``cmake``.

       * User will refers to this name, e.g. 'spack install cmake'.
       * It can include ``_``, ``-``, and numbers (it can even start with a
         number).

    2. The class name, "Cmake".  This is formed by converting `-` or
       ``_`` in the module name to camel case.  If the name starts with
       a number, we prefix the class name with ``_``. Examples:

          ===========  ==========
          Module Name  Class Name
          ===========  ==========
          foo_bar      FooBar
          docbook-xml  DocbookXml
          FooBar       Foobar
          3proxy       _3proxy
          ===========  ==========

        The class name is what spack looks for when it loads a package module.

    **Required Attributes**

    Aside from proper naming, here is the bare minimum set of things you
    need when you make a package:

    homepage:
        informational URL, so that users know what they're
        installing.

    url or url_for_version(self, version):
      If url, then the URL of the source archive that spack will fetch.
      If url_for_version(), then a method returning the URL required
      to fetch a particular version.

    install():
        This function tells spack how to build and install the
        software it downloaded.

    **Optional Attributes**

    You can also optionally add these attributes, if needed:

        list_url:
            Webpage to scrape for available version strings. Default is the
            directory containing the tarball; use this if the default isn't
            correct so that invoking 'spack versions' will work for this
            package.

        url_version(self, version):
            When spack downloads packages at particular versions, it just
            converts version to string with str(version).  Override this if
            your package needs special version formatting in its URL.  boost
            is an example of a package that needs this.

    ***Creating Packages***

    As a package creator, you can probably ignore most of the preceding
    information, because you can use the 'spack create' command to do it
    all automatically.

    You as the package creator generally only have to worry about writing
    your install function and specifying dependencies.

    **spack create**

    Most software comes in nicely packaged tarballs, like this one

    http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.10.2.tar.gz

    Taking a page from homebrew, spack deduces pretty much everything it
    needs to know from the URL above.  If you simply type this::

        spack create http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.10.2.tar.gz

    Spack will download the tarball, generate an md5 hash, figure out the
    version and the name of the package from the URL, and create a new
    package file for you with all the names and attributes set correctly.

    Once this skeleton code is generated, spack pops up the new package in
    your $EDITOR so that you can modify the parts that need changes.

    **Dependencies**

    If your package requires another in order to build, you can specify that
    like this:

    .. code-block:: python

       class Stackwalker(Package):
           ...
           depends_on("libdwarf")
           ...

    This tells spack that before it builds stackwalker, it needs to build
    the libdwarf package as well.  Note that this is the module name, not
    the class name (The class name is really only used by spack to find
    your package).

    Spack will download an install each dependency before it installs your
    package.  In addtion, it will add -L, -I, and rpath arguments to your
    compiler and linker for each dependency.  In most cases, this allows you
    to avoid specifying any dependencies in your configure or cmake line;
    you can just run configure or cmake without any additional arguments and
    it will find the dependencies automatically.

    **The Install Function**

    The install function is designed so that someone not too terribly familiar
    with Python could write a package installer.  For example, we put a number
    of commands in install scope that you can use almost like shell commands.
    These include make, configure, cmake, rm, rmtree, mkdir, mkdirp, and
    others.

    You can see above in the cmake script that these commands are used to run
    configure and make almost like they're used on the command line.  The
    only difference is that they are python function calls and not shell
    commands.

    It may be puzzling to you where the commands and functions in install live.
    They are NOT instance variables on the class; this would require us to
    type 'self.' all the time and it makes the install code unnecessarily long.
    Rather, spack puts these commands and variables in *module* scope for your
    Package subclass.  Since each package has its own module, this doesn't
    pollute other namespaces, and it allows you to more easily implement an
    install function.

    For a full list of commands and variables available in module scope, see
    the add_commands_to_module() function in this class. This is where most
    of them are created and set on the module.

    **Parallel Builds**

    By default, Spack will run make in parallel when you run make() in your
    install function.  Spack figures out how many cores are available on
    your system and runs make with -j<cores>.  If you do not want this
    behavior, you can explicitly mark a package not to use parallel make:

    .. code-block:: python

       class SomePackage(Package):
           ...
           parallel = False
           ...

    This changes the default behavior so that make is sequential.  If you still
    want to build some parts in parallel, you can do this in your install
    function:

    .. code-block:: python

       make(parallel=True)

    Likewise, if you do not supply parallel = True in your Package, you can
    keep the default parallel behavior and run make like this when you want a
    sequential build:

    .. code-block:: python

       make(parallel=False)

    **Package Lifecycle**

    This section is really only for developers of new spack commands.

    A package's lifecycle over a run of Spack looks something like this:

    .. code-block:: python

       p = Package()             # Done for you by spack

       p.do_fetch()              # downloads tarball from a URL
       p.do_stage()              # expands tarball in a temp directory
       p.do_patch()              # applies patches to expanded source
       p.do_install()            # calls package's install() function
       p.do_uninstall()          # removes install directory

    There are also some other commands that clean the build area:

    .. code-block:: python

       p.do_clean()              # removes the stage directory entirely
       p.do_restage()            # removes the build directory and
                                 # re-expands the archive.

    The convention used here is that a ``do_*`` function is intended to be
    called internally by Spack commands (in spack.cmd).  These aren't for
    package writers to override, and doing so may break the functionality
    of the Package class.

    Package creators override functions like install() (all of them do this),
    clean() (some of them do this), and others to provide custom behavior.
