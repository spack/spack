    """This is the superclass for all spack packages.

    ***The Package class***

    At its core, a package consists of a set of software to be installed.
    A package may focus on a piece of software and its associated software
    dependencies or it may simply be a set, or bundle, of software.  The
    former requires defining how to fetch, verify (via, e.g., sha256), build,
    and install that software and the packages it depends on, so that
    dependencies can be installed along with the package itself.   The latter,
    sometimes referred to as a ``no-source`` package, requires only defining
    the packages to be built.

    Packages are written in pure Python.

    There are two main parts of a Spack package:

      1. **The package class**.  Classes contain ``directives``, which are special functions, that
         add metadata (versions, patches, dependencies, and other information) to packages (see
         ``directives.py``). Directives provide the constraints that are used as input to the
         concretizer.

      2. **Package instances**. Once instantiated, a package can be passed to the PackageInstaller.
         It calls methods like ``do_stage()`` on the ``Package`` object, and it uses those to drive
         user-implemented methods like ``patch()``, ``install()``, and other build steps. To
         install software, an instantiated package needs a *concrete* spec, which guides the
         behavior of the various install methods.

    Packages are imported from repos (see ``repo.py``).

    **Package DSL**

    Look in ``lib/spack/docs`` or check https://spack.readthedocs.io for
    the full documentation of the package domain-specific language.  That
    used to be partially documented here, but as it grew, the docs here
    became increasingly out of date.

    **Package Lifecycle**

    A package's lifecycle over a run of Spack looks something like this:

    .. code-block:: python

       p = Package()             # Done for you by spack

       p.do_fetch()              # downloads tarball from a URL (or VCS)
       p.do_stage()              # expands tarball in a temp directory
       p.do_patch()              # applies patches to expanded source
       p.do_uninstall()          # removes install directory

    although packages that do not have code have nothing to fetch so omit
    ``p.do_fetch()``.

    There are also some other commands that clean the build area:

    .. code-block:: python

       p.do_clean()              # removes the stage directory entirely
       p.do_restage()            # removes the build directory and
                                 # re-expands the archive.

    The convention used here is that a ``do_*`` function is intended to be
    called internally by Spack commands (in ``spack.cmd``).  These aren't for
    package writers to override, and doing so may break the functionality
    of the Package class.

    Package creators have a lot of freedom, and they could technically
    override anything in this class.  That is not usually required.

    For most use cases.  Package creators typically just add attributes
    like ``homepage`` and, for a code-based package, ``url``, or functions
    such as ``install()``.
    There are many custom ``Package`` subclasses in the
    ``spack.build_systems`` package that make things even easier for
    specific build systems.

        overridden by an extendable package to set up the module of
        its extensions. This is useful if there are some common steps
        to installing all extensions for a certain package.

        Examples:

        1. Extensions often need to invoke the ``python`` interpreter
           from the Python installation being extended. This routine
           can put a ``python()`` Executable object in the module scope
           for the extension package to simplify extension installs.

           scope that point to ``mpicc``, ``mpicxx``, etc., allowing
           them to be called by common name regardless of which MPI is used.

        3. BLAS/LAPACK implementations can set some variables
           indicating the path to their libraries, since these
           paths differ by BLAS/LAPACK implementation.

        Args:
            module (spack.package_base.PackageBase.module): The Python ``module``
                object of the dependent package. Packages can use this to set
                module-scope variables for the dependent to use.

                about to be built. This allows the extendee (self) to
