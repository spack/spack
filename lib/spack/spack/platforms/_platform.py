    To add a new type of platform (such as cray_xe), create a subclass and set all the
    class attributes such as priority, front_target, back_target, front_os, back_os.

    Platform also contain a priority class attribute. A lower number signifies higher
    priority. These numbers are arbitrarily set and can be changed though often there
    isn't much need unless a new platform is added and the user wants that to be
    detected first.

    Targets are created inside the platform subclasses. Most architecture (like linux,
    and darwin) will have only one target family (x86_64) but in the case of Cray
    machines, there is both a frontend and backend processor. The user can specify
    which targets are present on front-end and back-end architecture.

    Depending on the platform, operating systems are either autodetected or are
    set. The user can set the frontend and backend operating setting by the class
    attributes front_os and back_os. The operating system will be responsible for
    compiler detection.
