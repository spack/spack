"""These tests ensure that our lock works correctly.

This can be run in two ways.

First, it can be run as a node-local test, with a typical invocation like
this::

    spack test lock

You can *also* run it as an MPI program, which allows you to test locks
across nodes.  So, e.g., you can run the test like this::

    mpirun -n 7 spack test lock

And it will test locking correctness among MPI processes.  Ideally, you
want the MPI processes to span across multiple nodes, so, e.g., for SLURM
you might do this::

    srun -N 7 -n 7 -m cyclic spack test lock

You can use this to test whether your shared filesystem properly supports
POSIX reader-writer locking with byte ranges through fcntl.

If you want to test on multiple filesystems, you can modify the
``locations`` list below.  By default it looks like this::

    locations = [
        tempfile.gettempdir(),  # standard tmp directory (potentially local)
        '/nfs/tmp2/%u',         # NFS tmp mount
        '/p/lscratch*/%u'       # Lustre scratch mount
    ]

Add names and paths for your preferred filesystem mounts to test on them;
the tests are parametrized to run on all the filesystems listed in this
dict.  Note that 'tmp' will be skipped for MPI testing, as it is often a
node-local filesystem, and multi-node tests will fail if the locks aren't
actually on a shared filesystem.
