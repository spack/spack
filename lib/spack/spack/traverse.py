    (2001, 2nd edition) by Cormen, Thomas H.; Leiserson, Charles E.; Rivest, Ronald L.;
    Stein, Clifford.

    The algorithm in plain English: realize that (1) we only append a vertex A before
    traversing all possible paths to any descendant B (that means A is always appended
    to reverse_order after all its descendants) and (2) while following paths from
    A -> B, we push B to reverse_order the first time it is reached, and guarantee its
    ancestors are always appended and its descendants are not (on the first path
    this is thanks to backtracking, on any other path we do not follow B as its
    already seen.)

    The neat thing about this algorithm is that it can operate on an immutable DAG,
    it doesn't require marking or popping edges, and it works in linear time (in
    vertices and edges).
