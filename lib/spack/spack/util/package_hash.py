    The multimethod that will be chosen at runtime depends on the package spec and on
    whether we're on the darwin platform *at build time* (the darwin condition for
    implementation 3 is dynamic). We know the package spec statically; we don't know
    statically what the runtime environment will be. We need to include things that can
    possibly affect package behavior in the package hash, and we want to exclude things
    when we know that they will not affect package behavior.

    If we're at version 4.0, we know that implementation 1 will win, because some @when
    for 2, 3, and 4 will be `False`. We should only include implementation 1.

    If we're at version 1.0, we know that implementation 2 will win, because it
    overrides implementation 1.  We should only include implementation 2.

    If we're at version 3.0, we know that implementation 4 will win, because it
    overrides implementation 1 (the default), and some @when on all others will be
    False.

    If we're at version 2.0, it's a bit more complicated. We know we can remove
    implementations 2 and 4, because their @when's will never be satisfied. But, the
    choice between implementations 1 and 3 will happen at runtime (this is a bad example
    because the spec itself has platform information, and we should prefer to use that,
    but we allow arbitrary boolean expressions in @when's, so this example suffices).
    For this case, we end up needing to include *both* implementation 1 and 3 in the
