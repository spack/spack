        Create a spack.Variant with extra logic to handle the cases a library
        should be compiled (i.e., passed to b2 via --with-libraries)

        Args:
         name (str): name of the variant

         default (str,bool,None):  The default value for the variant

                                    By default, each variant is enabled. A value of
                                    'None' is converted to 'True'. This is done so
                                    that each variants.add can omit a default
                                    value. The inversion is done because
                                    spack.Variant assumes a default value of
                                    'False'.

         buildable (str): The version string indicating which versions
                          for which the library should be compiled or `None`

         conflicts (list): The variant's conflicts

                           Each conflict is a dict with keys 'when' and 'msg'
                           that are identical to the values for the spack
                           'conflicts' directive.

         requires (list): The variant's requires

                           Each requirement is a dict with keys 'spec', 'when', and
                           'msg' that are identical to the values for the spack
                           'requires' directive.

         kwargs (dict): The rest of the arguments forwarded on to the
                        spack.Variant constructor

                        This should include 'when' which indicates the version
                        range for which the variant is valid. This is distinct
                        from 'buildable' as the latter only indicates when the
                        library should be compiled.

                        For example, the coroutine2 library was introduced in
                        version 1.59.0, but was converted to header-only in version
                        1.64.0. In this case, when="@1.59.0:" and
                        buildable="@1.59.0:1.64.0".

                        Conversely, the exception library was introduced in 1.36.0
                        as header-only, but required compilation after 1.47.0. In
                        this case, when="@1.36.0:" and buildable="@1.47.0:".
