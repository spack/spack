    # this patch is required to fix a programming error that is not acceptable by
    # latest compilers. In particular, the `std::min` function was given `int` and
    # `unsigned int` arguments. The `int` argument is explicitly casted to `unsigned int`.
    # This patch was created by the staff at the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre.
