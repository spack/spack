class CommonsLogging(Package):
    """When writing a library it is very useful to log information. However
    there are many logging implementations out there, and a library cannot
    impose the use of a particular one on the overall application that the
    library is a part of.

    The Logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging
    implementations. A library that uses the commons-logging API can be used
    with any logging implementation at runtime. Commons-logging comes with
    support for a number of popular logging implementations, and writing
    adapters for others is a reasonably simple task."""
