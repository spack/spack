    """The DSDP software is a free open source implementation of an
    interior-point method for semidefinite programming. It provides primal and

    has relatively low memory requirements for an interior-point method. It
    allows feasible and infeasible starting points and provides approximate
    certificates of infeasibility when no feasible solution exists."""
