    neutron transportation simulation code.  It is adapted from a
    similar miniapp provided by Andrew Siegel, whose algorithm is
    described in [1], where only one process in a compute node
    is used, and the compute nodes are divided into memory nodes
    and tracking nodes.    Memory nodes do not participate in particle
    tracking. Obviously, there is a lot of resource waste in this design.
