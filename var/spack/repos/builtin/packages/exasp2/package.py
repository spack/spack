class Exasp2(MakefilePackage):
    """ExaSP2 is a reference implementation of typical linear algebra algorithms
    and workloads for a quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) electronic structure
    code. The algorithm is based on a recursive second-order Fermi-Operator
    expansion method (SP2) and is tailored for density functional based
    tight-binding calculations of material systems. The SP2 algorithm variants
    are part of the Los Alamos Transferable Tight-binding for Energetics
    (LATTE) code, based on a matrix expansion of the Fermi operator in a
    recursive series of generalized matrix-matrix multiplications. It is
    created and maintained by Co-Design Center for Particle Applications
    (CoPA). The code is intended to serve as a vehicle for co-design by
    allowing others to extend and/or reimplement as needed to test performance
    of new architectures, programming models, etc."""
