    """FreeIPMI provides in-band and out-of-band IPMI software based on the IPMI
    v1.5/2.0 specification. The IPMI specification defines a set of interfaces
    for platform management and is implemented by a number vendors for system
    management. The features of IPMI that most users will be interested in are
    sensor monitoring, system event monitoring, power control, and
    serial-over-LAN (SOL). The FreeIPMI tools and libraries listed below should
    provide users with the ability to access and utilize these and many other
    features. A number of useful features for large HPC or cluster environments
    have also been implemented into FreeIPMI. See the README or FAQ for more
    info."""
