    """Apache Kylin is an open source, distributed Analytical Data
    Warehouse for Big Data; it was designed to provide OLAP (Online
    Analytical Processing) capability in the big data era. By renovating
    the multi-dimensional cube and precalculation technology on Hadoop
    and Spark, Kylin is able to achieve near constant query speed
    regardless of the ever-growing data volume. Reducing query latency
    from minutes to sub-second, Kylin brings online analytics back to big
    data."""
