    """Electric Fence (or eFence) is a memory debugger written by Bruce Perens.
    It consists of a library which programmers can link into their code to override
    the C standard library memory management functions. eFence triggers a program
    crash when the memory error occurs, so a debugger can be used to inspect the
    code that caused the error."""
