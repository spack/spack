class Libtlx(CMakePackage):
    """tlx is a collection of C++ helpers and extensions universally needed,
    but not found in the STL.
    The most important design goals and conventions are:
    1) high modularity with as little dependencies between
       modules as possible.
    2) attempt to never break existing interfaces.
    3) compile on all platforms with C++ - smartphones, supercomputers,
       windows, etc.
    4) zero external dependencies: no additional libraries are required.
    5) warning and bug-freeness on all compilers.
    6) keep overhead down - small overall size such that is can be included
       without bloating applications."""
