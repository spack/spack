    """libXTrap is the Xlib-based client API for the DEC-XTRAP extension.

    XTrap was a proposed standard extension for X11R5 which facilitated the
    capturing of server protocol and synthesizing core input events.

    Digital participated in the X Consortium's xtest working group which chose
    to evolve XTrap functionality into the XTEST & RECORD extensions for X11R6.

    As X11R6 was released in 1994, XTrap has now been deprecated for over
    15 years, and uses of it should be quite rare."""
