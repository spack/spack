    """miniGMG is a compact benchmark for understanding the performance
    challenges associated with geometric multigrid solvers
    found in applications built from AMR MG frameworks
    like CHOMBO or BoxLib when running
    on modern multi- and manycore-based supercomputers.
    It includes both productive reference examples as well as
    highly-optimized implementations for CPUs and GPUs.
    It is sufficiently general that it has been used to evaluate
    a broad range of research topics including PGAS programming models
    and algorithmic tradeoffs inherit in multigrid. miniGMG was developed
    under the CACHE Joint Math-CS Institute.

    Note, miniGMG code has been supersceded by HPGMG. """
