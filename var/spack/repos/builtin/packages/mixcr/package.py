    """MiXCR is a universal framework that processes big immunome data from
    raw sequences to quantitated clonotypes. MiXCR efficiently handles
    paired- and single-end reads, considers sequence quality, corrects PCR
    errors and identifies germline hypermutations. The software supports
    both partial- and full-length profiling and employs all available RNA or
    DNA information, including sequences upstream of V and downstream of J
    gene segments."""
