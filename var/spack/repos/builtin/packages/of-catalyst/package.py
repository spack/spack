class OfCatalyst(CMakePackage):
    """Of-catalyst is a library for OpenFOAM that provides a runtime-selectable
    function object for embedding ParaView Catalyst in-situ visualization
    into arbitrary OpenFOAM simulations.
    Supports in-situ conversion of the following types:
      1) finite volume meshes and fields, single or multi-region;
      2) finite area meshes and fields, single region;
      3) lagrangian (clouds), single or multiple clouds.
    This offering is part of the community repository supported by OpenCFD Ltd,
    producer and distributor of the OpenFOAM software via www.openfoam.com,
