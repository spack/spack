        system-provided OpenGL utility (GLU) libraries from hardware vendors.
        Please download and install the GLU drivers/libraries for your
        graphics hardware separately, and then set that up as an external
        package.  An example of a working packages.yaml:

        packages:
          openglu:
            buildable: False
            externals:
            - spec: openglu@1.3
              prefix: /opt/opengl

        In that case, /opt/opengl/ should contain these two folders:

        include/GL/       (opengl headers, including "glu.h")
        lib               (opengl libraries, including "libGLU.so")

        On Apple Darwin (OS X, macOS) systems, this package is
        normally installed as part of the XCode Command Line Tools in
        /usr/X11R6, so a working packages.yaml would be

        packages:
          openglu:
            buildable: False
            externals:
            - spec: openglu@1.3
              prefix: /usr/X11R6

        In that case, /usr/X11R6 should contain

        include/GL       (GLU headers, including "glu.h")
        lib              (GLU libraries, including "libGLU.dylib")"""

        raise InstallError(msg)
