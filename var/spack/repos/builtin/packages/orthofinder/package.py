    comparative genomics.

    It finds orthologues and orthogroups infers rooted  gene trees for all
    orthogroups and infers a rooted species tree for the species being
    analysed. OrthoFinder also provides comprehensive statistics for
    comparative genomic analyses. OrthoFinder is simple to use and all you

    in FASTA format."""
