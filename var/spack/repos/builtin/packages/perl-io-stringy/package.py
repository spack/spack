class PerlIoStringy(PerlPackage):
    """This toolkit primarily provides modules for performing both traditional
    and object-oriented i/o) on things other than normal filehandles; in
    particular, IO::Scalar, IO::ScalarArray, and IO::Lines.

    In the more-traditional IO::Handle front, we have IO::AtomicFile which may
    be used to painlessly create files which are updated atomically.

    And in the "this-may-prove-useful" corner, we have IO::Wrap, whose exported
    wraphandle() function will clothe anything that's not a blessed object in
    an IO::Handle-like wrapper... so you can just use OO syntax and stop
    worrying about whether your function's caller handed you a string, a
    globref, or a FileHandle."""
