    """MCE - Many-Core Engine for Perl providing parallel processing
    capabilities.

    MCE spawns a pool of workers and therefore does not fork a new process per
    each element of data. Instead, MCE follows a bank queuing model. Imagine
    the line being the data and bank-tellers the parallel workers. MCE enhances
    that model by adding the ability to chunk the next n elements from the
    input stream to the next available worker."""
