class PerlModuleBuild(PerlPackage):
    """Module::Build is a system for building, testing, and installing Perl
    modules. It is meant to be an alternative to ExtUtils::MakeMaker.
    Developers may alter the behavior of the module through subclassing in a
    much more straightforward way than with MakeMaker. It also does not
    require a make on your system - most of the Module::Build code is
    pure-perl and written in a very cross-platform way.
