class PerlPerlUnsafeSignals(PerlPackage):
    """Quoting perl581delta:

        In Perl 5.8.0 the so-called "safe signals" were introduced. This means
        that Perl no longer handles signals immediately but instead "between
        opcodes", when it is safe to do so. The earlier immediate handling
        easily could corrupt the internal state of Perl, resulting in
        mysterious crashes.

        It's possible since perl 5.8.1 to globally disable this feature by
        using the PERL_SIGNALS environment variables (as specified in
        "PERL_SIGNALS" in perlrun); but there's no way to disable it locally,
        for a short period of time. That's however something you might want to
        do, if, for example, your Perl program calls a C routine that will
        potentially run for a long time and for which you want to set a
        timeout.

        This module therefore allows you to define UNSAFE_SIGNALS blocks in
        which signals will be handled "unsafely".

        Note that, no matter how short you make the unsafe block, it will still
        be unsafe. Use with caution."""
