    PNG as its output format. The interface has been designed to be as simple
    and intuitive as possible. It supports plotting and reading pixels in the
    RGB (red, green, blue), HSV (hue, saturation, value/brightness) and CMYK
    (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) colour spaces, basic shapes, scaling,
    bilinear interpolation, full TrueType antialiased and rotated text support,
    bezier curves, opening existing PNG images and more.
