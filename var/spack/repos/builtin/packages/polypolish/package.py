    """Polypolish is a tool for polishing genome assemblies with short reads.
    Unlike other tools in this category, Polypolish uses SAM files where each
    read has been aligned to all possible locations (not just a single best
    location). This allows it to repair errors in repeat regions that other
    alignment-based polishers cannot fix."""
