    you deal with it.

    Building a command-line interface? Found yourself uttering "argh!"
    while struggling with the API of argparse? Don't like the complexity
    but need the power? Argh is a smart wrapper for argparse. Argparse is
    a very powerful tool; Argh just makes it easy to use."""
