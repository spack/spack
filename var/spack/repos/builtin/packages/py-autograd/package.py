class PyAutograd(PythonPackage):
    """Autograd can automatically differentiate native Python and
    Numpy code. It can handle a large subset of Python's features,
    including loops, ifs, recursion and closures, and it can even take
    derivatives of derivatives of derivatives. It supports
    reverse-mode differentiation (a.k.a. backpropagation), which means
    it can efficiently take gradients of scalar-valued functions with
    respect to array-valued arguments, as well as forward-mode
    differentiation, and the two can be composed arbitrarily. The main
    intended application of Autograd is gradient-based
    optimization. For more information, check out the tutorial and the
    examples directory."""
