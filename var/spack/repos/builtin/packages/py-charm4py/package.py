    programming framework for Python, for the productive development of fast,

    has been used to develop applications that run on a wide range of devices:

    # 1) hacks setup.py to apply a patch to the charm++ Makefile
    # causing the Makefile to include libcudart when building libcharm.so
    # 2) inserts the patchfile needed to do so.
    # This is convoluted, but best way I see since setup.py untars the
    # charm++ sources and we need to patch a file that is in the tarball.
