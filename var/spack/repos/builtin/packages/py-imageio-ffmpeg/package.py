    reliable ffmpeg wrapper for working with video files. It
    implements two simple generator functions for reading and
    writing data from/to ffmpeg, which reliably terminate the
    ffmpeg process when done. It also takes care of publishing
    platform-specific wheels that include the binary ffmpeg
    executables."""
