class PyNumexpr3(PythonPackage):
    """Numexpr3 is a fast numerical expression evaluator for NumPy. With it,
    expressions that operate on arrays (like "3*a+4*b") are accelerated and
    use less memory than doing the same calculation in Python.
    In addition, its multi-threaded capabilities can make use of all your
    cores, which may accelerate computations, most specially if they are not
    memory-bounded (e.g. those using transcendental functions).
    Compared to NumExpr 2.6, functions have been re-written in a fashion such
    that gcc can auto-vectorize them with SIMD instruction sets such as
    SSE2 or AVX2, if your processor supports them. Use of a newer version of
    gcc such as 5.4 is strongly recommended."""
