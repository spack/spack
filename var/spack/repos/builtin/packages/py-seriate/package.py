class PySeriate(PythonPackage):
    """This is a Python implementation of Seriation
    algorithm. Seriation is an approach for ordering elements in a set
    so that the sum of the sequential pairwise distances is
    minimal. We state this task as a Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)
    and leverage the powerful Google's or-tools to do
    heavy-lifting. Since TSP is NP-hard, it is not possible to
    calculate the precise solution for a big number of
    elements. However, the or-tools' heuristics work very well in
    practice, and they are used in e.g. Google Maps."""
