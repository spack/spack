    """Tinyarrays are similar to NumPy arrays, but optimized for
    small sizes. Common operations on very small arrays are to 3-7
    times faster than with NumPy (with NumPy 1.6 it used to be up
    to 35 times), and 3 times less memory is used to store them.
    Tinyarrays are useful if you need many small arrays of numbers,
    and cannot combine them into a few large ones."""
