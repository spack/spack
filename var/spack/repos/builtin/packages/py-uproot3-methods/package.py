class PyUproot3Methods(PythonPackage):
    """Pythonic mix-ins for ROOT classes.

    This package is typically used as a dependency for uproot 3.x, to define
    methods on the classes that are automatically generated from ROOT files.
    This includes histograms (TH*) and physics objects like TLorentzVectors.
    The reason it's a separate library is so that we can add physics-specific
    functionality on a shorter timescale than we can update Uproot 3 itself,
    which is purely an I/O package."""
