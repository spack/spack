    """QBank is a unique dynamic reservation-based allocation management system
    that manages the utilization of computational resources in a multi-project
    environment. It is used in conjunction with a resource management system
    allowing an organization to guarantee greater fairness and enforce mission
    priorities by associating a charge with the use of computational resources
    and allocating resource credits which limit how much of the resources may
    be used at what time and by whom. It tracks resource utilization and allows
    for insightful planning."""
