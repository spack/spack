    """Algorithms for Calculating Microarray Enrichment (ACME).

    ACME (Algorithms for Calculating Microarray Enrichment) is a set of
    tools for analysing tiling array ChIP/chip, DNAse hypersensitivity, or
    other experiments that result in regions of the genome showing
    "enrichment". It does not rely on a specific array technology (although
    the array should be a "tiling" array), is very general (can be applied
    in experiments resulting in regions of enrichment), and is very
    insensitive to array noise or normalization methods. It is also very
    fast and can be applied on whole-genome tiling array experiments quite
    easily with enough memory."""
