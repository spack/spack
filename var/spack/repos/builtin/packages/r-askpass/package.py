class RAskpass(RPackage):
    """Safe Password Entry for R, Git, and SSH.

    Cross-platform utilities for prompting the user for credentials or a
    passphrase, for example to authenticate with a server or read a protected
    key. Includes native programs for MacOS and Windows, hence no 'tcltk' is
    required. Password entry can be invoked in two different ways: directly
    from R via the askpass() function, or indirectly as password-entry back-end
    for 'ssh-agent' or 'git-credential' via the SSH_ASKPASS and GIT_ASKPASS
    environment variables. Thereby the user can be prompted for credentials or
    a passphrase if needed when R calls out to git or ssh."""
