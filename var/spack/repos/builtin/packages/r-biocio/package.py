class RBiocio(RPackage):
    """Standard Input and Output for Bioconductor Packages.

    Implements `import()` and `export()` standard generics for importing and
    exporting biological data formats. `import()` supports whole-file as well
    as chunk-wise iterative import. The `import()` interface optionally
    provides a standard mechanism for 'lazy' access via `filter()` (on row or
    element-like components of the file resource), `select()` (on column-like
    components of the file resource) and `collect()`. The `import()` interface
    optionally provides transparent access to remote (e.g. via https) as well
    as local access. Developers can register a file extension, e.g., `.loom`
    for dispatch from character-based URIs to specific `import()` / `export()`
    methods based on classes representing file types, e.g., `LoomFile()`."""
