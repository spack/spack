class RBiomformat(RPackage):
    """An interface package for the BIOM file format.

    This is an R package for interfacing with the BIOM format. This package
    includes basic tools for reading biom-format files, accessing and
    subsetting data tables from a biom object (which is more complex than a
    single table), as well as limited support for writing a biom-object back
    to a biom-format file. The design of this API is intended to match the
    python API and other tools included with the biom-format project, but
    with a decidedly "R flavor" that should be familiar to R users. This
    includes S4 classes and methods, as well as extensions of common core
    functions/methods."""
