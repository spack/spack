    """Disciplined Convex Optimization.

    An object-oriented modeling language for disciplined convex programming
    (DCP) as described in Fu, Narasimhan, and Boyd (2020,
    <doi:10.18637/jss.v094.i14>). It allows the user to formulate convex
    optimization problems in a natural way following mathematical convention
    and DCP rules. The system analyzes the problem, verifies its convexity,
    converts it into a canonical form, and hands it off to an appropriate
    solver to obtain the solution. Interfaces to solvers on CRAN and elsewhere
    are provided, both commercial and open source."""
