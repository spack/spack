    """Density-Preserving Data Visualization via Non-Linear Dimensionality
    Reduction.

    Implements the density-preserving modification to t-SNE and UMAP described
    by Narayan et al. (2020) . The non-linear dimensionality reduction
    techniques t-SNE and UMAP enable users to summarise complex
    high-dimensional sequencing data such as single cell RNAseq using lower
    dimensional representations. These lower dimensional representations enable
    the visualisation of discrete transcriptional states, as well as continuous
    trajectory (for example, in early development). However, these methods
    focus on the local neighbourhood structure of the data. In some cases, this
    results in misleading visualisations, where the density of cells in the
    low-dimensional embedding does not represent the transcriptional
    heterogeneity of data in the original high-dimensional space. den-SNE and
    densMAP aim to enable more accurate visual interpretation of
    high-dimensional datasets by producing lower-dimensional embeddings that
    accurately represent the heterogeneity of the original high-dimensional
    space, enabling the identification of homogeneous and heterogeneous cell
    states. This accuracy is accomplished by including in the optimisation
    process a term which considers the local density of points in the original
    high-dimensional space. This can help to create visualisations that are
    more representative of heterogeneity in the original high-dimensional
    space."""
