    """Statistics: Multivariate Inference via the Energy of Data

    E-statistics (energy) tests and statistics for multivariate and univariate
    inference, including distance correlation, one-sample, two-sample, and
    multi-sample tests for comparing multivariate distributions, are
    implemented. Measuring and testing multivariate independence based on
    distance correlation, partial distance correlation, multivariate
    goodness-of-fit tests, k-groups and hierarchical clustering based on energy
    distance, testing for multivariate normality, distance components (disco)
    for non-parametric  analysis of structured data, and other energy
    statistics/methods are implemented."""
