class RFastcluster(RPackage):
    """This is a two-in-one package which provides interfaces to both R
       and 'Python'. It implements fast hierarchical, agglomerative
       clustering routines. Part of the functionality is designed as drop-in
       replacement for existing routines: linkage() in the 'SciPy' package
       'scipy.cluster.hierarchy', hclust() in R's 'stats' package, and the
       'flashClust' package. It provides the same functionality with the
       benefit of a much faster implementation. Moreover, there are
       memory-saving routines for clustering of vector data, which go beyond
       what the existing packages provide. For information on how to install
       the 'Python' files, see the file INSTALL in the source distribution."""
