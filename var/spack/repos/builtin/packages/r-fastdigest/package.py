class RFastdigest(RPackage):
    """Fast, Low Memory-Footprint Digests of R Objects.

    Provides an R interface to Bob Jenkin's streaming, non-cryptographic
    'SpookyHash' hash algorithm for use in digest-based comparisons of R
    objects. 'fastdigest' plugs directly into R's internal serialization
    machinery, allowing digests of all R objects the serialize() function
    supports, including reference-style objects via custom hooks. Speed is high
    and scales linearly by object size; memory usage is constant and
    negligible."""
