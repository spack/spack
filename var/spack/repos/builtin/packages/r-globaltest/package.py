    Variable, with Applications to Gene Set Testing.

    The global test tests groups of covariates (or features) for association
    with a response variable. This package implements the test with diagnostic
    plots and multiple testing utilities, along with several functions to
    facilitate the use of this test for gene set testing of GO and KEGG
