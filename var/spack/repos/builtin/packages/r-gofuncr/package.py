    """Gene ontology enrichment using FUNC.

    GOfuncR performs a gene ontology enrichment analysis based on the
    ontology enrichment software FUNC. GO-annotations are obtained from
    OrganismDb or OrgDb packages ('Homo.sapiens' by default); the GO-graph
    is included in the package and updated regularly (27-Mar-2019). GOfuncR
    provides the standard candidate vs. background enrichment analysis using
    the hypergeometric test, as well as three additional tests: (i) the
    Wilcoxon rank-sum test that is used when genes are ranked, (ii) a
    binomial test that is used when genes are associated with two counts and
    (iii) a Chi-square or Fisher's exact test that is used in cases when
    genes are associated with four counts. To correct for multiple testing
    and interdependency of the tests, family-wise error rates are computed
    based on random permutations of the gene-associated variables. GOfuncR
    also provides tools for exploring the ontology graph and the
    annotations, and options to take gene-length or spatial clustering of
    genes into account. It is also possible to provide custom gene
    coordinates, annotations and ontologies."""
