    Hydrological Time Series.

    S3 functions implementing both statistical and graphical goodness-of-fit
    measures between observed and simulated values, mainly oriented to be used
    during the calibration, validation, and application of hydrological models.
    Missing values in observed and/or simulated values can be removed before
