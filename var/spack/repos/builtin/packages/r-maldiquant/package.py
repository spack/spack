    """Quantitative Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Data.

    A complete analysis pipeline for matrix-assisted laser
    desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) and other two-dimensional
    mass spectrometry data. In addition to commonly used plotting and
    processing methods it includes distinctive features, namely baseline
    subtraction methods such as morphological filters (TopHat) or the
    statistics-sensitive non-linear iterative peak-clipping algorithm (SNIP),
    peak alignment using warping functions, handling of replicated measurements
    as well as allowing spectra with different resolutions."""
