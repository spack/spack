class RMaldiquant(RPackage):
    """A complete analysis pipeline for matrix-assisted laser
       desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) and other
       two-dimensional mass spectrometry data. In addition to commonly used
       plotting and processing methods it includes distinctive features,
       namely baseline subtraction methods such as morphological filters
       (TopHat) or the statistics-sensitive non-linear iterative peak-clipping
       algorithm (SNIP), peak alignment using warping functions, handling of
       replicated measurements as well as allowing spectra with different
       resolutions."""
