class RModeltools(RPackage):
    """Tools and Classes for Statistical Models.

    A collection of tools to deal with statistical models.  The functionality
    is experimental and the user interface is likely to change in the future.
    The documentation is rather terse, but packages `coin' and `party' have
    some working examples. However, if you find the implemented ideas
    interesting we would be very interested in a discussion of this proposal.
    Contributions are more than welcome!"""
