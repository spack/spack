class RMulttest(RPackage):
    """Resampling-based multiple hypothesis testing.

       Non-parametric bootstrap and permutation resampling-based multiple
       testing procedures (including empirical Bayes methods) for controlling
       the family-wise error rate (FWER), generalized family-wise error rate
       (gFWER), tail probability of the proportion of false positives (TPPFP),
       and false discovery rate (FDR). Several choices of bootstrap-based null
       distribution are implemented (centered, centered and scaled, quantile-
       transformed). Single-step and step-wise methods are available. Tests
       based on a variety of t- and F-statistics (including t-statistics based
       on regression parameters from linear and survival models as well as
       those based on correlation parameters) are included. When probing
       hypotheses with t-statistics, users may also select a potentially faster
       null distribution which is multivariate normal with mean zero and
       variance covariance matrix derived from the vector influence function.
       Results are reported in terms of adjusted p-values, confidence regions
       and test statistic cutoffs. The procedures are directly applicable to
       identifying differentially expressed genes in DNA microarray
       experiments."""
