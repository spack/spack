class RMulttest(RPackage):
    """Resampling-based multiple hypothesis testing.

    Non-parametric bootstrap and permutation resampling-based multiple
    testing procedures (including empirical Bayes methods) for controlling
    the family-wise error rate (FWER), generalized family-wise error rate
    (gFWER), tail probability of the proportion of false positives (TPPFP),
    and false discovery rate (FDR). Several choices of bootstrap-based null
    distribution are implemented (centered, centered and scaled, quantile-
    transformed). Single-step and step-wise methods are available. Tests
    based on a variety of t- and F-statistics (including t-statistics based
    on regression parameters from linear and survival models as well as
    those based on correlation parameters) are included. When probing
    hypotheses with t-statistics, users may also select a potentially faster
    null distribution which is multivariate normal with mean zero and
    variance covariance matrix derived from the vector influence function.
    Results are reported in terms of adjusted p-values, confidence regions
    and test statistic cutoffs. The procedures are directly applicable to
    identifying differentially expressed genes in DNA microarray
    experiments."""
