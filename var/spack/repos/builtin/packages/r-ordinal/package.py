    """Regression Models for Ordinal Data.

    Implementation of cumulative link (mixed) models also known as ordered
    regression models, proportional odds models, proportional hazards models
    for grouped survival times and ordered logit/probit/... models. Estimation
    is via maximum likelihood and mixed models are fitted with the Laplace
    approximation and adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature. Multiple random effect
    terms are allowed and they may be nested, crossed or partially
    nested/crossed. Restrictions of symmetry and equidistance can be imposed on
    the thresholds (cut-points/intercepts). Standard model methods are
    available (summary, anova, drop-methods, step, confint, predict etc.) in
    addition to profile methods and slice methods for visualizing the
    likelihood function and checking convergence."""
