    A set of tools that solves a common set of problems: you need to break a
    big problem down into manageable pieces, operate on each piece and then put
    all the pieces back together. For example, you might want to fit a model to
    each spatial location or time point in your study, summarise data by panels
    or collapse high-dimensional arrays to simpler summary statistics. The
    development of 'plyr' has been generously supported by 'Becton
    Dickinson'."""
