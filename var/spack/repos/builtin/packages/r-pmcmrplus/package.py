    """Calculate Pairwise Multiple Comparisons of Mean Rank Sums Extended.

    For one-way layout experiments the one-way ANOVA can be performed as an
    omnibus test. All-pairs multiple comparisons tests (Tukey-Kramer test,
    Scheffe test, LSD-test) and many-to-one tests (Dunnett test) for normally
    distributed residuals and equal within variance are available. Furthermore,
    all-pairs tests (Games-Howell test, Tamhane's T2 test, Dunnett T3 test,
    Ury-Wiggins-Hochberg test) and many-to-one (Tamhane-Dunnett Test) for
    normally distributed residuals and heterogeneous variances are provided.
    Van der Waerden's normal scores test for omnibus, all-pairs and many-to-one
    tests is provided for non-normally distributed residuals and homogeneous
    variances. The Kruskal-Wallis, BWS and Anderson-Darling omnibus test and
    all-pairs tests (Nemenyi test, Dunn test, Conover test,
    Dwass-Steele-Critchlow- Fligner test) as well as many-to-one (Nemenyi test,
    Dunn test, U-test) are given for the analysis of variance by ranks.
    Non-parametric trend tests (Jonckheere test, Cuzick test, Johnson-Mehrotra
    test, Spearman test) are included.  In addition, a Friedman-test for
    one-way ANOVA with repeated measures on ranks (CRBD) and Skillings-Mack
    test for unbalanced CRBD is provided with consequent all-pairs tests
    (Nemenyi test, Siegel test, Miller test, Conover test, Exact test) and
    many-to-one tests (Nemenyi test, Demsar test, Exact test).  A trend can be
    tested with Pages's test. Durbin's test for a two-way balanced incomplete
    block design (BIBD) is given in this package as well as Gore's test for
    CRBD with multiple observations per cell is given.  Outlier tests, Mandel's
    k- and h statistic as well as functions for Type I error and Power analysis
    as well as generic summary, print and plot methods are provided."""
