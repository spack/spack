class RRMethodss3(RPackage):
    """S3 Methods Simplified.

    Methods that simplify the setup of S3 generic functions and S3 methods.
    Major effort has been made in making definition of methods as simple as
    possible with a minimum of maintenance for package developers. For example,
    generic functions are created automatically, if missing, and naming
    conflict are automatically solved, if possible. The method setMethodS3() is
    a good start for those who in the future may want to migrate to S4. This is
    a cross-platform package implemented in pure R that generates standard S3
    methods."""
