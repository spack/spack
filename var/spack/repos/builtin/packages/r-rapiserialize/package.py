    """R API Serialization.

    This package provides other packages with access to the internal R
    serialization code. Access to this code is provided at the C function level
    by using the registration of native function mechanism. Client packages
    simply include a single header file RApiSerializeAPI.h provided by this
    package. This packages builds on the Rhpc package by Junji Nakano and Ei-ji
    Nakama which also includes a (partial) copy of the file
    src/main/serialize.c from R itself. The R Core group is the original author
    of the serialization code made available by this package."""
