    """'Rcpp' Bindings for 'Annoy', a Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors

    'Annoy' is a small C++ library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors written
    for efficient memory usage as well an ability to load from / save to disk.
    This package provides an R interface by relying on the 'Rcpp' package,
    exposing the same interface as the original Python wrapper to 'Annoy'. See
    <https://github.com/spotify/annoy> for more on 'Annoy'. 'Annoy' is released
    under Version 2.0 of the Apache License. Also included is a small Windows
    port of 'mmap' which is released under the MIT license."""
