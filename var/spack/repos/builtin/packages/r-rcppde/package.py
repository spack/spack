    """Global Optimization by Differential Evolution in C++.

    An efficient C++ based implementation of the 'DEoptim' function which
    performs global optimization by differential evolution. Its creation was
    motivated by trying to see if the old approximation "easier, shorter,
    faster: pick any two" could in fact be extended to achieving all three
    goals while moving the code from plain old C to modern C++. The initial
    version did in fact do so, but a good part of the gain was due to an
    implicit code review which eliminated a few inefficiencies which have since
    been eliminated in 'DEoptim'."""
