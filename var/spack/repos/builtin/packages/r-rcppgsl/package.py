    """'Rcpp' Integration for 'GNU GSL' Vectors and Matrices.

    'Rcpp' integration for 'GNU GSL' vectors and matrices The 'GNU Scientific
    Library' (or 'GSL') is a collection of numerical routines for scientific
    computing. It is particularly useful for C and C++ programs as it provides
    a standard C interface to a wide range of mathematical routines. There are
    over 1000 functions in total with an extensive test suite. The 'RcppGSL'
    package provides an easy-to-use interface between 'GSL' data structures and
    R using concepts from 'Rcpp' which is itself a package that eases the
    interfaces between R and C++. This package also serves as a prime example
    of how to build a package that uses 'Rcpp' to connect to another
    third-party library. The 'autoconf' script, 'inline' plugin and example
    package can all be used as a stanza to write a similar package against
    another library."""
