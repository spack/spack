    The configuration format defined by 'TOML' (which expands to "Tom's Obvious
    Markup Language") specifies an excellent format (described at
    <https://toml.io/en/>) suitable for both human editing as well as the
    common uses of a machine-readable format. This package uses 'Rcpp' to
    connect the 'cpptoml' parser written by Chase Geigle (in C++11) to R."""
