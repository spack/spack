    """C++ Classes to Embed R in C++ (and C) Applications.

    C++ classes to embed R in C++ applications The 'RInside' packages makes it
    easier to have "R inside" your C++ application by providing a C++
    wrapperclass providing the R interpreter. As R itself is embedded into your
    application, a shared library build of R is required. This works on Linux,
    OS X and even on Windows provided you use the same tools used to build R
    itself. Numerous examples are provided in the eight subdirectories of the
    examples/ directory of the installed package: standard, mpi (for parallel
    computing) qt (showing how to embed 'RInside' inside a Qt GUI application),
    wt (showing how to build a "web-application" using the Wt toolkit),
    armadillo (for 'RInside' use with 'RcppArmadillo') and eigen (for 'RInside'
    use with 'RcppEigen'). The example use GNUmakefile(s) with GNU extensions,
    so a GNU make is required (and will use the GNUmakefile automatically).
    Doxygen-generated documentation of the C++ classes is available at the
    'RInside' website as well."""
