class RRspectra(RPackage):
    """Solvers for Large-Scale Eigenvalue and SVD Problems.

    R interface to the 'Spectra' library <https://spectralib.org/> for
    large-scale eigenvalue and SVD problems. It is typically used to compute a
    few eigenvalues/vectors of an n by n matrix, e.g., the k largest
    eigenvalues, which is usually more efficient than eigen() if k << n. This
    package provides the 'eigs()' function that does the similar job as in
    'Matlab', 'Octave', 'Python SciPy' and 'Julia'. It also provides the
    'svds()' function to calculate the largest k singular values and
    corresponding singular vectors of a real matrix. The matrix to be computed
    on can be dense, sparse, or in the form of an operator defined by the
    user."""
