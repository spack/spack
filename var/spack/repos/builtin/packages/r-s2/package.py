    """Spherical Geometry Operators Using the S2 Geometry Library

    Provides R bindings for Google's s2 library for geometric calculations on
    the sphere. High-performance constructors and exporters provide high
    compatibility with existing spatial packages, transformers construct new
    geometries from existing geometries, predicates provide a means to select
    geometries based on spatial relationships, and accessors extract
    information about geometries."""
