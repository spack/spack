    """Datasets for Spatial Analysis

    Diverse spatial datasets for demonstrating, benchmarking and teaching
    spatial data analysis.  It includes R data of class sf (defined by the
    package 'sf'), Spatial ('sp'), and nb ('spdep'). Unlike other spatial data
    packages such as 'rnaturalearth' and 'maps',  it also contains data stored
    in a range of file formats including GeoJSON, ESRI Shapefile and
    GeoPackage.  Some of the datasets are designed to illustrate specific
    analysis techniques. cycle_hire() and cycle_hire_osm(), for example, is
    designed to illustrate point pattern analysis techniques."""
