class RSseq(RPackage):
    """Shrinkage estimation of dispersion in Negative Binomial models for RNA-
       seq experiments with small sample size.

       The purpose of this package is to discover the genes that are
       differentially expressed between two conditions in RNA-seq experiments.
       Gene expression is measured in counts of transcripts and modeled with
       the Negative Binomial (NB) distribution using a shrinkage approach for
       dispersion estimation. The method of moment (MM) estimates for
       dispersion are shrunk towards an estimated target, which minimizes the
       average squared difference between the shrinkage estimates and the
       initial estimates. The exact per-gene probability under the NB model is
       calculated, and used to test the hypothesis that the expected expression
       of a gene in two conditions identically follow a NB distribution."""
