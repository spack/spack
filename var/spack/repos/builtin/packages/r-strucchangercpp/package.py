class RStrucchangercpp(RPackage):
    """Testing, Monitoring, and Dating Structural Changes: C++ Version.

    A fast implementation with additional experimental features for testing,
    monitoring and dating structural changes in (linear) regression models.
    'strucchangeRcpp' features tests/methods from the generalized fluctuation test
    framework as well as from the F test (Chow test) framework. This includes
    methods to fit, plot and test fluctuation processes (e.g. cumulative/moving
    sum, recursive/moving estimates) and F statistics, respectively. These methods
    are described in Zeileis et al. (2002) <doi:10.18637/jss.v007.i02>. Finally,
    the breakpoints in regression models with structural changes can be estimated
    together with confidence intervals, and their magnitude as well as the model
    fit can be evaluated using a variety of statistical measures."""
