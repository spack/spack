    """Surrogate Variable Analysis.

    The sva package contains functions for removing batch effects and other
    unwanted variation in high-throughput experiment. Specifically, the sva
    package contains functions for the identifying and building surrogate
    variables for high-dimensional data sets. Surrogate variables are
    covariates constructed directly from high-dimensional data (like gene
    expression/RNA sequencing/methylation/brain imaging data) that can be
    used in subsequent analyses to adjust for unknown, unmodeled, or latent
    sources of noise. The sva package can be used to remove artifacts in
    three ways: (1) identifying and estimating surrogate variables for
    unknown sources of variation in high-throughput experiments (Leek and
    Storey 2007 PLoS Genetics,2008 PNAS), (2) directly removing known batch
    effects using ComBat (Johnson et al. 2007 Biostatistics) and (3)
    removing batch effects with known control probes (Leek 2014 biorXiv).
    Removing batch effects and using surrogate variables in differential
    expression analysis have been shown to reduce dependence, stabilize
    error rate estimates, and improve reproducibility, see (Leek and Storey
    2007 PLoS Genetics, 2008 PNAS or Leek et al. 2011 Nat. Reviews
    Genetics)."""
