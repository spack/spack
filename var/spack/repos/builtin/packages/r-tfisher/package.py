    """Optimal Thresholding Fisher's P-Value Combination Method.

    We provide the cumulative distribution function (CDF), quantile, and
    statistical power calculator for a collection of thresholding Fisher's
    p-value combination methods, including Fisher's p-value combination method,
    truncated product method and, in particular, soft-thresholding Fisher's
    p-value combination method which is proven to be optimal in some context of
    signal detection. The p-value calculator for the omnibus version of these
    tests are also included. For reference, please see Hong Zhang and Zheyang
    Wu. "TFisher Tests: Optimal and Adaptive Thresholding for Combining
    p-Values", submitted."""
