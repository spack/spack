class RTictoc(RPackage):
    """Functions for timing R scripts, as well as implementations of Stack and
    List structures.

    This package provides the timing functions 'tic' and 'toc' that can be
    nested. One can record all timings while a complex script is running, and
    examine the values later. It is also possible to instrument the timing
    calls with custom callbacks. In addition, this package provides class
    'Stack', implemented as a vector, and class 'List', implemented as a list,
    both of which support operations 'push', 'pop', 'first', 'last' and
    'clear'."""
