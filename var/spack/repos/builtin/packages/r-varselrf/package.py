    """Variable Selection using Random Forests.

    Variable selection from random forests using both backwards variable
    elimination (for the selection of small sets of non-redundant variables)
    and selection based on the importance spectrum (somewhat similar to scree
    plots; for the selection of large, potentially highly-correlated
    variables). Main applications in high-dimensional data (e.g., microarray
    data, and other genomics and proteomics applications)."""
