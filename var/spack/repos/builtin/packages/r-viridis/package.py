class RViridis(RPackage):
    """Colorblind-Friendly Color Maps for R.

    Color maps designed to improve graph readability for readers with common
    forms of color blindness and/or color vision deficiency. The color maps are
    also perceptually-uniform, both in regular form and also when converted to
    black-and-white for printing. This package also contains 'ggplot2' bindings
    for discrete and continuous color and fill scales. A lean version of the
    package called 'viridisLite' that does not include the 'ggplot2' bindings
    can be found at <https://cran.r-project.org/package=viridisLite>."""
