    Color maps designed to improve graph readability for readers with common
    forms of color blindness and/or color vision deficiency. The color maps are
    also perceptually-uniform, both in regular form and also when converted to
    black-and-white for printing. This is the 'lite' version of the 'viridis'
    package that also contains 'ggplot2' bindings for discrete and continuous
    color and fill scales and can be found at
