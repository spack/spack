    """Lightweight Well-Known Geometry Parsing

    Provides a minimal R and C++ API for parsing well-known binary and
    well-known text representation of geometries to and from R-native formats.
    Well-known binary is compact and fast to parse; well-known text is
    human-readable and is useful for writing tests. These formats are only
    useful in R if the information they contain can be accessed in R, for which
    high-performance functions are provided here."""
