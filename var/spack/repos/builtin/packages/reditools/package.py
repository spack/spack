    """REDItools: python scripts for RNA editing detection by RNA-Seq data.

    REDItools are simple python scripts conceived to facilitate the
    investigation of RNA editing at large-scale and devoted to research groups
    that would to explore such phenomenon in own data but don't have sufficient
    bioinformatics skills. They work on main operating systems (although
    unix/linux-based OS are preferred), can handle reads from whatever platform
    in the standard BAM format and implement a variety of filters."""
