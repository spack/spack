    # Known limitations of this installer:
    # * This really only installs the command line version of the program. To
    #   install GUI support there are extra packages needed that I can't easily
    #   test right now (should be installable via yum as a temp workaround):
    #   libgtk-x11-2.0.so libgdk-x11-2.0.so libatk-1.0.so libgdk_pixbuf-2.0.so
    #   Those libraries appear to be provided by: pango gdk-pixbuf2 gtk2
    #
    # * There are two popular environment variables that can be set, but vary from
    #   place to place, so future enhancement maybe to support STATATMP and TMPDIR.
    #
    # * I haven't tested any installer version but 15.

    # ./unix/linux64/docs.taz
    # ./unix/linux64/setrwxp
    # ./unix/linux64/ado.taz

    # ./unix/linux64/base.taz
    # ./unix/linux64/bins.taz
    # ./license.pdf
    # ./stata15.ico
    # ./install
    #
    # The installation scripts aren't really necessary:
    # ./install is a shell script that sets up the environment.
    # ./unix/linux64/setrwxp is a shell script that ensures permissions.
    # ./unix/linux64/inst2 is the actual installation script.
    #
    # 1. There is a markfile that is the version number. Stata uses this for
    # for doing version checks/updates.
    # echo $(date) > installed.150
    #
    # 2. Then it extracts the tar.gz files: ado.taz base.taz bins.taz docs.taz
    #
    # 3. It copies installer scripts to root directory
    # cp ./unix/linux64/setrwxp setrwxp
    # cp ./unix/linux64/inst2 inst2
    #
    # 4. Then it checks for proper permissions:
    # chmod 750 setrwxp inst2
    # ./setrwxp now
    #
    # 5. The last step has to be run manually since it is an interactive binary
    # for configuring the license key. Load the module and run:
    # $ stinit
