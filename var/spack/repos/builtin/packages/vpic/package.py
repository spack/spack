       kinetic plasmas in one, two, or three spatial dimensions. It employs a
       second-order, explicit, leapfrog algorithm to update charged particle
       positions and velocities in order to solve the relativistic kinetic
       equation for each species in the plasma, along with a full Maxwell
       description for the electric and magnetic fields evolved via a second-
       order finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) solve.
