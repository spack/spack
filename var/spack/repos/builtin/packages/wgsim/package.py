    """Wgsim is a small tool for simulating sequence reads from a reference
    genome.

    It is able to simulate diploid genomes with SNPs and insertion/deletion
    (INDEL) polymorphisms, and simulate reads with uniform substitution
    sequencing errors. It does not generate INDEL sequencing errors, but this
    can be partly compensated by simulating INDEL polymorphisms."""
