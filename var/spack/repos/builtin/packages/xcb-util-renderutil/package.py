    """The XCB util modules provides a number of libraries which sit on top
    of libxcb, the core X protocol library, and some of the extension
    libraries. These experimental libraries provide convenience functions
    and interfaces which make the raw X protocol more usable. Some of the
    libraries also provide client-side code which is not strictly part of
    the X protocol but which have traditionally been provided by Xlib."""
